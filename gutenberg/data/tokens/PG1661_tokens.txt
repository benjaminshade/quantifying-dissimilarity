i
a

in

i
to
sherlock
holmes
she
is
always
the
woman
i
have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name
in
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex
it
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
irene
adler
all
emotions
and
that
one
particularly
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind
he
was
i
take
it
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen
but
as
a
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in
a
false
position
he
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions
save
with
a
gibe
and
a
sneer
they
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer
excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men
motives
and
actions
but
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
a
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results
grit
in
a
sensitive
instrument
or
a
crack
in
one
of
his
own
lenses
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
a
strong
emotion
in
a
nature
such
as
his
and
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him
and
that
woman
was
the
late
irene
adler
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory
i
had
seen
little
of
holmes
lately
my
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other
my
own
complete
happiness
and
the
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention
while
holmes
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
bohemian
soul
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
baker
street
buried
among
his
old
books
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
ambition
the
drowsiness
of
the
drug
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
nature
he
was
still
as
ever
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
crime
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
clues
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
police
from
time
to
time
i
heard
some
vague
account
of
his
doings
of
his
summons
to
odessa
in
the
case
of
the
trepoff
murder
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
atkinson
brothers
at
trincomalee
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
holland
beyond
these
signs
of
his
activity
however
which
i
merely
shared
with
all
the
readers
of
the
daily
press
i
knew
little
of
my
former
friend
and
companion
one
night
it
was
on
the
twentieth
of
march
i
was
returning
from
a
journey
to
a
patient
for
i
had
now
returned
to
civil
practice
when
my
way
led
me
through
baker
street
as
i
passed
the
door
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
wooing
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
study
in
scarlet
i
was
seized
with
a
keen
desire
to
see
holmes
again
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
powers
his
rooms
were
brilliantly
lit
and
even
as
i
looked
up
i
saw
his
tall
spare
figure
pass
twice
in
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
blind
he
was
pacing
the
room
swiftly
eagerly
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
to
me
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
habit
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
story
he
was
at
work
again
he
had
risen
out
of
his
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
problem
i
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
own
his
manner
was
not
effusive
it
seldom
was
but
he
was
glad
i
think
to
see
me
with
hardly
a
word
spoken
but
with
a
kindly
eye
he
waved
me
to
an
armchair
threw
across
his
case
of
cigars
and
indicated
a
spirit
case
and
a
gasogene
in
the
corner
then
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
fashion
wedlock
suits
you
he
remarked
i
think
watson
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and
a
half
pounds
since
i
saw
you
seven
i
answered
indeed
i
should
have
thought
a
little
more
just
a
trifle
more
i
fancy
watson
and
in
practice
again
i
observe
you
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
harness
then
how
do
you
know
i
see
it
i
deduce
it
how
do
i
know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
lately
and
that
you
have
a
most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
girl
my
dear
holmes
said
i
this
is
too
much
you
would
certainly
have
been
burned
had
you
lived
a
few
centuries
ago
it
is
true
that
i
had
a
country
walk
on
thursday
and
came
home
in
a
dreadful
mess
but
as
i
have
changed
my
clothes
i
ca
imagine
how
you
deduce
it
as
to
mary
jane
she
is
incorrigible
and
my
wife
has
given
her
notice
but
there
again
i
fail
to
see
how
you
work
it
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
long
nervous
hands
together
it
is
simplicity
itself
said
he
my
eyes
tell
me
that
on
the
inside
of
your
left
shoe
just
where
the
firelight
strikes
it
the
leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
cuts
obviously
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
it
hence
you
see
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
weather
and
that
you
had
a
particularly
malignant
specimen
of
the
london
slavey
as
to
your
practice
if
a
gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling
of
iodoform
with
a
black
mark
of
nitrate
of
silver
upon
his
right
forefinger
and
a
bulge
on
the
right
side
of
his
to
show
where
he
has
secreted
his
stethoscope
i
must
be
dull
indeed
if
i
do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
profession
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
deduction
when
i
hear
you
give
your
reasons
i
remarked
the
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that
i
could
easily
do
it
myself
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning
i
am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
process
and
yet
i
believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
yours
quite
so
he
answered
lighting
a
cigarette
and
throwing
himself
down
into
an
armchair
you
see
but
you
do
not
observe
the
distinction
is
clear
for
example
you
have
frequently
seen
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
the
hall
to
this
room
frequently
how
often
well
some
hundreds
of
times
then
how
many
are
there
how
many
i
do
know
quite
so
you
have
not
observed
and
yet
you
have
seen
that
is
just
my
point
now
i
know
that
there
are
seventeen
steps
because
i
have
both
seen
and
observed
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little
problems
and
since
you
are
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
trifling
experiences
you
may
be
interested
in
this
he
threw
over
a
sheet
of
thick
which
had
been
lying
open
upon
the
table
it
came
by
the
last
post
said
he
read
it
aloud
the
note
was
undated
and
without
either
signature
or
address
there
will
call
upon
you
at
a
quarter
to
eight
it
said
a
gentleman
who
desires
to
consult
you
upon
a
matter
of
the
very
deepest
moment
your
recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
europe
have
shown
that
you
are
one
who
may
safely
be
trusted
with
matters
which
are
of
an
importance
which
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
this
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received
be
in
your
chamber
then
at
that
hour
and
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
your
visitor
wear
a
mask
this
is
indeed
a
mystery
i
remarked
what
do
you
imagine
that
it
means
i
have
no
data
yet
it
is
a
capital
mistake
to
theorize
before
one
has
data
insensibly
one
begins
to
twist
facts
to
suit
theories
instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts
but
the
note
itself
what
do
you
deduce
from
it
i
carefully
examined
the
writing
and
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
presumably
well
to
do
i
remarked
endeavouring
to
imitate
my
companion
processes
such
paper
could
not
be
bought
under
half
a
crown
a
packet
it
is
peculiarly
strong
and
stiff
peculiar
that
is
the
very
word
said
holmes
it
is
not
an
english
paper
at
all
hold
it
up
to
the
light
i
did
so
and
saw
a
large
e
with
a
small
g
a
p
and
a
large
g
with
a
small
t
woven
into
the
texture
of
the
paper
what
do
you
make
of
that
asked
holmes
the
name
of
the
maker
no
doubt
or
his
monogram
rather
not
at
all
the
with
the
small
stands
for
which
is
the
german
for
it
is
a
customary
contraction
like
our
of
course
stands
for
now
for
the
let
us
glance
at
our
continental
gazetteer
he
took
down
a
heavy
brown
volume
from
his
shelves
eglow
eglonitz
here
we
are
egria
it
is
in
a
country
in
bohemia
not
far
from
carlsbad
as
being
the
scene
of
the
death
of
wallenstein
and
for
its
numerous
and
ha
ha
my
boy
what
do
you
make
of
that
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
sent
up
a
great
blue
triumphant
cloud
from
his
cigarette
the
paper
was
made
in
bohemia
i
said
precisely
and
the
man
who
wrote
the
note
is
a
german
do
you
note
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
sentence
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received
a
frenchman
or
russian
could
not
have
written
that
it
is
the
german
who
is
so
uncourteous
to
his
verbs
it
only
remains
therefore
to
discover
what
is
wanted
by
this
german
who
writes
upon
bohemian
paper
and
prefers
wearing
a
mask
to
showing
his
face
and
here
he
comes
if
i
am
not
mistaken
to
resolve
all
our
doubts
as
he
spoke
there
was
the
sharp
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
grating
wheels
against
the
curb
followed
by
a
sharp
pull
at
the
bell
holmes
whistled
a
pair
by
the
sound
said
he
yes
he
continued
glancing
out
of
the
window
a
nice
little
brougham
and
a
pair
of
beauties
a
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
apiece
there
money
in
this
case
watson
if
there
is
nothing
else
i
think
that
i
had
better
go
holmes
not
a
bit
doctor
stay
where
you
are
i
am
lost
without
my
boswell
and
this
promises
to
be
interesting
it
would
be
a
pity
to
miss
it
but
your
client
never
mind
him
i
may
want
your
help
and
so
may
he
here
he
comes
sit
down
in
that
armchair
doctor
and
give
us
your
best
attention
a
slow
and
heavy
step
which
had
been
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
in
the
passage
paused
immediately
outside
the
door
then
there
was
a
loud
and
authoritative
tap
come
in
said
holmes
a
man
entered
who
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
six
feet
six
inches
in
height
with
the
chest
and
limbs
of
a
hercules
his
dress
was
rich
with
a
richness
which
would
in
england
be
looked
upon
as
akin
to
bad
taste
heavy
bands
of
astrakhan
were
slashed
across
the
sleeves
and
fronts
of
his
coat
while
the
deep
blue
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
lined
with
silk
and
secured
at
the
neck
with
a
brooch
which
consisted
of
a
single
flaming
beryl
boots
which
extended
halfway
up
his
calves
and
which
were
trimmed
at
the
tops
with
rich
brown
fur
completed
the
impression
of
barbaric
opulence
which
was
suggested
by
his
whole
appearance
he
carried
a
hat
in
his
hand
while
he
wore
across
the
upper
part
of
his
face
extending
down
past
the
cheekbones
a
black
vizard
mask
which
he
had
apparently
adjusted
that
very
moment
for
his
hand
was
still
raised
to
it
as
he
entered
from
the
lower
part
of
the
face
he
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
strong
character
with
a
thick
hanging
lip
and
a
long
straight
chin
suggestive
of
resolution
pushed
to
the
length
of
obstinacy
you
had
my
note
he
asked
with
a
deep
harsh
voice
and
a
strongly
marked
german
accent
i
told
you
that
i
would
call
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
as
if
uncertain
which
to
address
pray
take
a
seat
said
holmes
this
is
my
friend
and
colleague
watson
who
is
occasionally
good
enough
to
help
me
in
my
cases
whom
have
i
the
honour
to
address
you
may
address
me
as
the
count
von
kramm
a
bohemian
nobleman
i
understand
that
this
gentleman
your
friend
is
a
man
of
honour
and
discretion
whom
i
may
trust
with
a
matter
of
the
most
extreme
importance
if
not
i
should
much
prefer
to
communicate
with
you
alone
i
rose
to
go
but
holmes
caught
me
by
the
wrist
and
pushed
me
back
into
my
chair
it
is
both
or
none
said
he
you
may
say
before
this
gentleman
anything
which
you
may
say
to
me
the
count
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
then
i
must
begin
said
he
by
binding
you
both
to
absolute
secrecy
for
two
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
matter
will
be
of
no
importance
at
present
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
it
is
of
such
weight
it
may
have
an
influence
upon
european
history
i
promise
said
holmes
and
i
you
will
excuse
this
mask
continued
our
strange
visitor
the
august
person
who
employs
me
wishes
his
agent
to
be
unknown
to
you
and
i
may
confess
at
once
that
the
title
by
which
i
have
just
called
myself
is
not
exactly
my
own
i
was
aware
of
it
said
holmes
dryly
the
circumstances
are
of
great
delicacy
and
every
precaution
has
to
be
taken
to
quench
what
might
grow
to
be
an
immense
scandal
and
seriously
compromise
one
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
to
speak
plainly
the
matter
implicates
the
great
house
of
ormstein
hereditary
kings
of
bohemia
i
was
also
aware
of
that
murmured
holmes
settling
himself
down
in
his
armchair
and
closing
his
eyes
our
visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
languid
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no
doubt
depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in
europe
holmes
slowly
reopened
his
eyes
and
looked
impatiently
at
his
gigantic
client
if
your
majesty
would
condescend
to
state
your
case
he
remarked
i
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
the
man
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
then
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
he
tore
the
mask
from
his
face
and
hurled
it
upon
the
ground
you
are
right
he
cried
i
am
the
king
why
should
i
attempt
to
conceal
it
why
indeed
murmured
holmes
your
majesty
had
not
spoken
before
i
was
aware
that
i
was
addressing
wilhelm
gottsreich
sigismond
von
ormstein
grand
duke
of
and
hereditary
king
of
bohemia
but
you
can
understand
said
our
strange
visitor
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
forehead
you
can
understand
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
person
yet
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
i
could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent
without
putting
myself
in
his
power
i
have
come
incognito
from
prague
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
you
then
pray
consult
said
holmes
shutting
his
eyes
once
more
the
facts
are
briefly
these
some
five
years
ago
during
a
lengthy
visit
to
warsaw
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
adventuress
irene
adler
the
name
is
no
doubt
familiar
to
you
kindly
look
her
up
in
my
index
doctor
murmured
holmes
without
opening
his
eyes
for
many
years
he
had
adopted
a
system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men
and
things
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name
a
subject
or
a
person
on
which
he
could
not
at
once
furnish
information
in
this
case
i
found
her
biography
sandwiched
in
between
that
of
a
hebrew
rabbi
and
that
of
a
who
had
written
a
monograph
upon
the
fishes
let
me
see
said
holmes
hum
born
in
new
jersey
in
the
year
contralto
hum
la
scala
hum
prima
donna
imperial
opera
of
warsaw
yes
retired
from
operatic
stage
ha
living
in
london
quite
so
your
majesty
as
i
understand
became
entangled
with
this
young
person
wrote
her
some
compromising
letters
and
is
now
desirous
of
getting
those
letters
back
precisely
so
but
how
was
there
a
secret
marriage
none
no
legal
papers
or
certificates
none
then
i
fail
to
follow
your
majesty
if
this
young
person
should
produce
her
letters
for
blackmailing
or
other
purposes
how
is
she
to
prove
their
authenticity
there
is
the
writing
pooh
pooh
forgery
my
private
stolen
my
own
seal
imitated
my
photograph
bought
we
were
both
in
the
photograph
oh
dear
that
is
very
bad
your
majesty
has
indeed
committed
an
indiscretion
i
was
mad
insane
you
have
compromised
yourself
seriously
i
was
only
crown
prince
then
i
was
young
i
am
but
thirty
now
it
must
be
recovered
we
have
tried
and
failed
your
majesty
must
pay
it
must
be
bought
she
will
not
sell
stolen
then
five
attempts
have
been
made
twice
burglars
in
my
pay
ransacked
her
house
once
we
diverted
her
luggage
when
she
travelled
twice
she
has
been
waylaid
there
has
been
no
result
no
sign
of
it
absolutely
none
holmes
laughed
it
is
quite
a
pretty
little
problem
said
he
but
a
very
serious
one
to
me
returned
the
king
reproachfully
very
indeed
and
what
does
she
propose
to
do
with
the
photograph
to
ruin
me
but
how
i
am
about
to
be
married
so
i
have
heard
to
clotilde
lothman
von
second
daughter
of
the
king
of
scandinavia
you
may
know
the
strict
principles
of
her
family
she
is
herself
the
very
soul
of
delicacy
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
my
conduct
would
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
and
irene
adler
threatens
to
send
them
the
photograph
and
she
will
do
it
i
know
that
she
will
do
it
you
do
not
know
her
but
she
has
a
soul
of
steel
she
has
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women
and
the
mind
of
the
most
resolute
of
men
rather
than
i
should
marry
another
woman
there
are
no
lengths
to
which
she
would
not
go
none
you
are
sure
that
she
has
not
sent
it
yet
i
am
sure
and
why
because
she
has
said
that
she
would
send
it
on
the
day
when
the
betrothal
was
publicly
proclaimed
that
will
be
next
monday
oh
then
we
have
three
days
yet
said
holmes
with
a
yawn
that
is
very
fortunate
as
i
have
one
or
two
matters
of
importance
to
look
into
just
at
present
your
majesty
will
of
course
stay
in
london
for
the
present
certainly
you
will
find
me
at
the
langham
under
the
name
of
the
count
von
kramm
then
i
shall
drop
you
a
line
to
let
you
know
how
we
progress
pray
do
so
i
shall
be
all
anxiety
then
as
to
money
you
have
carte
blanche
absolutely
i
tell
you
that
i
would
give
one
of
the
provinces
of
my
kingdom
to
have
that
photograph
and
for
present
expenses
the
king
took
a
heavy
chamois
leather
bag
from
under
his
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table
there
are
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold
and
seven
hundred
in
notes
he
said
holmes
scribbled
a
receipt
upon
a
sheet
of
his
and
handed
it
to
him
and
mademoiselle
address
he
asked
is
briony
lodge
serpentine
avenue
john
wood
holmes
took
a
note
of
it
one
other
question
said
he
was
the
photograph
a
cabinet
it
was
then
your
majesty
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
soon
have
some
good
news
for
you
and
watson
he
added
as
the
wheels
of
the
royal
brougham
rolled
down
the
street
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
afternoon
at
three
i
should
like
to
chat
this
little
matter
over
with
you
ii
at
three
precisely
i
was
at
baker
street
but
holmes
had
not
yet
returned
the
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight
in
the
morning
i
sat
down
beside
the
fire
however
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
him
however
long
he
might
be
i
was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
inquiry
for
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which
i
have
already
recorded
still
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it
a
character
of
its
own
indeed
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
hand
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of
a
situation
and
his
keen
incisive
reasoning
which
made
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
work
and
to
follow
the
quick
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
mysteries
so
accustomed
was
i
to
his
invariable
success
that
the
very
possibility
of
his
failing
had
ceased
to
enter
into
my
head
it
was
close
upon
four
before
the
door
opened
and
a
groom
and
with
an
inflamed
face
and
disreputable
clothes
walked
into
the
room
accustomed
as
i
was
to
my
friend
amazing
powers
in
the
use
of
disguises
i
had
to
look
three
times
before
i
was
certain
that
it
was
indeed
he
with
a
nod
he
vanished
into
the
bedroom
whence
he
emerged
in
five
minutes
and
respectable
as
of
old
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
stretched
out
his
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes
well
really
he
cried
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
back
limp
and
helpless
in
the
chair
what
is
it
it
quite
too
funny
i
am
sure
you
could
never
guess
how
i
employed
my
morning
or
what
i
ended
by
doing
i
ca
imagine
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
watching
the
habits
and
perhaps
the
house
of
miss
irene
adler
quite
so
but
the
sequel
was
rather
unusual
i
will
tell
you
however
i
left
the
house
a
little
after
eight
this
morning
in
the
character
of
a
groom
out
of
work
there
is
a
wonderful
sympathy
and
freemasonry
among
horsey
men
be
one
of
them
and
you
will
know
all
that
there
is
to
know
i
soon
found
briony
lodge
it
is
a
bijou
villa
with
a
garden
at
the
back
but
built
out
in
front
right
up
to
the
road
two
stories
chubb
lock
to
the
door
large
on
the
right
side
well
furnished
with
long
windows
almost
to
the
floor
and
those
preposterous
english
window
fasteners
which
a
child
could
open
behind
there
was
nothing
remarkable
save
that
the
passage
window
could
be
reached
from
the
top
of
the
i
walked
round
it
and
examined
it
closely
from
every
point
of
view
but
without
noting
anything
else
of
interest
i
then
lounged
down
the
street
and
found
as
i
expected
that
there
was
a
mews
in
a
lane
which
runs
down
by
one
wall
of
the
garden
i
lent
the
ostlers
a
hand
in
rubbing
down
their
horses
and
received
in
exchange
twopence
a
glass
of
half
and
half
two
fills
of
shag
tobacco
and
as
much
information
as
i
could
desire
about
miss
adler
to
say
nothing
of
half
a
dozen
other
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
whom
i
was
not
in
the
least
interested
but
whose
biographies
i
was
compelled
to
listen
to
and
what
of
irene
adler
i
asked
oh
she
has
turned
all
the
men
heads
down
in
that
part
she
is
the
daintiest
thing
under
a
bonnet
on
this
planet
so
say
the
to
a
man
she
lives
quietly
sings
at
concerts
drives
out
at
five
every
day
and
returns
at
seven
sharp
for
dinner
seldom
goes
out
at
other
times
except
when
she
sings
has
only
one
male
visitor
but
a
good
deal
of
him
he
is
dark
handsome
and
dashing
never
calls
less
than
once
a
day
and
often
twice
he
is
a
godfrey
norton
of
the
inner
temple
see
the
advantages
of
a
cabman
as
a
confidant
they
had
driven
him
home
a
dozen
times
from
and
knew
all
about
him
when
i
had
listened
to
all
they
had
to
tell
i
began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
briony
lodge
once
more
and
to
think
over
my
plan
of
campaign
this
godfrey
norton
was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
matter
he
was
a
lawyer
that
sounded
ominous
what
was
the
relation
between
them
and
what
the
object
of
his
repeated
visits
was
she
his
client
his
friend
or
his
mistress
if
the
former
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
keeping
if
the
latter
it
was
less
likely
on
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether
i
should
continue
my
work
at
briony
lodge
or
turn
my
attention
to
the
gentleman
chambers
in
the
temple
it
was
a
delicate
point
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
inquiry
i
fear
that
i
bore
you
with
these
details
but
i
have
to
let
you
see
my
little
difficulties
if
you
are
to
understand
the
situation
i
am
following
you
closely
i
answered
i
was
still
balancing
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
a
hansom
cab
drove
up
to
briony
lodge
and
a
gentleman
sprang
out
he
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
dark
aquiline
and
moustached
evidently
the
man
of
whom
i
had
heard
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
wait
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
at
home
he
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour
and
i
could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
pacing
up
and
down
talking
excitedly
and
waving
his
arms
of
her
i
could
see
nothing
presently
he
emerged
looking
even
more
flurried
than
before
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
cab
he
pulled
a
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
earnestly
like
the
devil
he
shouted
to
gross
hankey
in
regent
street
and
then
to
the
church
of
monica
in
the
edgeware
road
half
a
guinea
if
you
do
it
in
twenty
minutes
away
they
went
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
i
should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came
a
neat
little
landau
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
and
his
tie
under
his
ear
while
all
the
tags
of
his
harness
were
sticking
out
of
the
buckles
it
had
pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the
hall
door
and
into
it
i
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
moment
but
she
was
a
lovely
woman
with
a
face
that
a
man
might
die
for
church
of
monica
john
she
cried
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
this
was
quite
too
good
to
lose
watson
i
was
just
balancing
whether
i
should
run
for
it
or
whether
i
should
perch
behind
her
landau
when
a
cab
came
through
the
street
the
driver
looked
twice
at
such
a
shabby
fare
but
i
jumped
in
before
he
could
object
church
of
monica
said
i
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
minutes
to
twelve
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
wind
my
cabby
drove
fast
i
do
think
i
ever
drove
faster
but
the
others
were
there
before
us
the
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when
i
arrived
i
paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
church
there
was
not
a
soul
there
save
the
two
whom
i
had
followed
and
a
surpliced
clergyman
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
with
them
they
were
all
three
standing
in
a
knot
in
front
of
the
altar
i
lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into
a
church
suddenly
to
my
surprise
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
me
and
godfrey
norton
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
me
god
he
cried
do
come
come
then
i
asked
man
come
only
three
minutes
or
it
wo
be
legal
i
was
up
to
the
altar
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
ear
and
vouching
for
things
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
irene
adler
spinster
to
godfrey
norton
bachelor
it
was
all
done
in
an
instant
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
front
it
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which
i
ever
found
myself
in
my
life
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
now
it
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
license
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without
a
witness
of
some
sort
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of
a
best
man
the
bride
gave
me
a
sovereign
and
i
mean
to
wear
it
on
my
in
memory
of
the
occasion
this
is
a
very
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
said
i
and
what
then
well
i
found
my
plans
very
seriously
menaced
it
looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate
departure
and
so
necessitate
very
prompt
and
energetic
measures
on
my
part
at
the
church
door
however
they
separated
he
driving
back
to
the
temple
and
she
to
her
own
house
shall
drive
out
in
the
park
at
five
as
usual
she
said
as
she
left
him
i
heard
no
more
they
drove
away
in
different
directions
and
i
went
off
to
make
my
own
arrangements
which
are
some
cold
beef
and
a
glass
of
beer
he
answered
ringing
the
bell
i
have
been
too
busy
to
think
of
food
and
i
am
likely
to
be
busier
still
this
evening
by
the
way
doctor
i
shall
want
your
i
shall
be
delighted
you
do
mind
breaking
the
law
not
in
the
least
nor
running
a
chance
of
arrest
not
in
a
good
cause
oh
the
cause
is
excellent
then
i
am
your
man
i
was
sure
that
i
might
rely
on
you
but
what
is
it
you
wish
when
turner
has
brought
in
the
tray
i
will
make
it
clear
to
you
now
he
said
as
he
turned
hungrily
on
the
simple
fare
that
our
landlady
had
provided
i
must
discuss
it
while
i
eat
for
i
have
not
much
time
it
is
nearly
five
now
in
two
hours
we
must
be
on
the
scene
of
action
miss
irene
or
madame
rather
returns
from
her
drive
at
seven
we
must
be
at
briony
lodge
to
meet
her
and
what
then
you
must
leave
that
to
me
i
have
already
arranged
what
is
to
occur
there
is
only
one
point
on
which
i
must
insist
you
must
not
interfere
come
what
may
you
understand
i
am
to
be
neutral
to
do
nothing
whatever
there
will
probably
be
some
small
unpleasantness
do
not
join
in
it
it
will
end
in
my
being
conveyed
into
the
house
four
or
five
minutes
afterwards
the
window
will
open
you
are
to
station
yourself
close
to
that
open
window
yes
you
are
to
watch
me
for
i
will
be
visible
to
you
yes
and
when
i
raise
my
hand
so
you
will
throw
into
the
room
what
i
give
you
to
throw
and
will
at
the
same
time
raise
the
cry
of
fire
you
quite
follow
me
entirely
it
is
nothing
very
formidable
he
said
taking
a
long
roll
from
his
pocket
it
is
an
ordinary
plumber
fitted
with
a
cap
at
either
end
to
make
it
your
task
is
confined
to
that
when
you
raise
your
cry
of
fire
it
will
be
taken
up
by
quite
a
number
of
people
you
may
then
walk
to
the
end
of
the
street
and
i
will
rejoin
you
in
ten
minutes
i
hope
that
i
have
made
myself
clear
i
am
to
remain
neutral
to
get
near
the
window
to
watch
you
and
at
the
signal
to
throw
in
this
object
then
to
raise
the
cry
of
fire
and
to
wait
you
at
the
corner
of
the
street
precisely
then
you
may
entirely
rely
on
me
that
is
excellent
i
think
perhaps
it
is
almost
time
that
i
prepare
for
the
new
role
i
have
to
play
he
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
in
the
character
of
an
amiable
and
nonconformist
clergyman
his
broad
black
hat
his
baggy
trousers
his
white
tie
his
sympathetic
smile
and
general
look
of
peering
and
benevolent
curiosity
were
such
as
john
hare
alone
could
have
equalled
it
was
not
merely
that
holmes
changed
his
costume
his
expression
his
manner
his
very
soul
seemed
to
vary
with
every
fresh
part
that
he
assumed
the
stage
lost
a
fine
actor
even
as
science
lost
an
acute
reasoner
when
he
became
a
specialist
in
crime
it
was
a
quarter
past
six
when
we
left
baker
street
and
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in
serpentine
avenue
it
was
already
dusk
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted
as
we
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
briony
lodge
waiting
for
the
coming
of
its
occupant
the
house
was
just
such
as
i
had
pictured
it
from
sherlock
holmes
succinct
description
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than
i
expected
on
the
contrary
for
a
small
street
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood
it
was
remarkably
animated
there
was
a
group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in
a
corner
a
with
his
wheel
two
guardsmen
who
were
flirting
with
a
and
several
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
you
see
remarked
holmes
as
we
paced
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
house
this
marriage
rather
simplifies
matters
the
photograph
becomes
a
weapon
now
the
chances
are
that
she
would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
godfrey
norton
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
princess
now
the
question
is
where
are
we
to
find
the
photograph
where
indeed
it
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
her
it
is
cabinet
size
too
large
for
easy
concealment
about
a
dress
she
knows
that
the
king
is
capable
of
having
her
waylaid
and
searched
two
attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
made
we
may
take
it
then
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
her
where
then
her
banker
or
her
lawyer
there
is
that
double
possibility
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
neither
women
are
naturally
secretive
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
secreting
why
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
else
she
could
trust
her
own
guardianship
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
a
business
man
besides
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within
a
few
days
it
must
be
where
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon
it
it
must
be
in
her
own
house
but
it
has
twice
been
burgled
pshaw
they
did
not
know
how
to
look
but
how
will
you
look
i
will
not
look
what
then
i
will
get
her
to
show
me
but
she
will
refuse
she
will
not
be
able
to
but
i
hear
the
rumble
of
wheels
it
is
her
carriage
now
carry
out
my
orders
to
the
letter
as
he
spoke
the
gleam
of
the
of
a
carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue
it
was
a
smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
briony
lodge
as
it
pulled
up
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning
a
copper
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention
a
fierce
quarrel
broke
out
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers
and
by
the
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side
a
blow
was
struck
and
in
an
instant
the
lady
who
had
stepped
from
her
carriage
was
the
centre
of
a
little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
men
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other
with
their
fists
and
sticks
holmes
dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect
the
lady
but
just
as
he
reached
her
he
gave
a
cry
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
the
blood
running
freely
down
his
face
at
his
fall
the
guardsmen
took
to
their
heels
in
one
direction
and
the
loungers
in
the
other
while
a
number
of
people
who
had
watched
the
scuffle
without
taking
part
in
it
crowded
in
to
help
the
lady
and
to
attend
to
the
injured
man
irene
adler
as
i
will
still
call
her
had
hurried
up
the
steps
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
hall
looking
back
into
the
street
is
the
poor
gentleman
much
hurt
she
asked
he
is
dead
cried
several
voices
no
no
there
life
in
him
shouted
another
but
he
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
hospital
he
a
brave
fellow
said
a
woman
they
would
have
had
the
lady
purse
and
watch
if
it
had
been
for
him
they
were
a
gang
and
a
rough
one
too
ah
he
breathing
now
he
ca
lie
in
the
street
may
we
bring
him
in
marm
surely
bring
him
into
the
there
is
a
comfortable
sofa
this
way
please
slowly
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
briony
lodge
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
room
while
i
still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
window
the
lamps
had
been
lit
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
so
that
i
could
see
holmes
as
he
lay
upon
the
couch
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
playing
but
i
know
that
i
never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when
i
saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom
i
was
conspiring
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
man
and
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
holmes
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
intrusted
to
me
i
hardened
my
heart
and
took
the
from
under
my
ulster
after
all
i
thought
we
are
not
injuring
her
we
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
another
holmes
had
sat
up
upon
the
couch
and
i
saw
him
motion
like
a
man
who
is
in
need
of
air
a
maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
window
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal
i
tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with
a
cry
of
fire
the
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators
well
dressed
and
ill
gentlemen
ostlers
and
joined
in
a
general
shriek
of
fire
thick
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
window
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
rushing
figures
and
a
moment
later
the
voice
of
holmes
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
slipping
through
the
shouting
crowd
i
made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend
arm
in
mine
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
uproar
he
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
edgeware
road
you
did
it
very
nicely
doctor
he
remarked
nothing
could
have
been
better
it
is
all
right
you
have
the
photograph
i
know
where
it
is
and
how
did
you
find
out
she
showed
me
as
i
told
you
she
would
i
am
still
in
the
dark
i
do
not
wish
to
make
a
mystery
said
he
laughing
the
matter
was
perfectly
simple
you
of
course
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
accomplice
they
were
all
engaged
for
the
evening
i
guessed
as
much
then
when
the
row
broke
out
i
had
a
little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
i
rushed
forward
fell
down
clapped
my
hand
to
my
face
and
became
a
piteous
spectacle
it
is
an
old
trick
that
also
i
could
fathom
then
they
carried
me
in
she
was
bound
to
have
me
in
what
else
could
she
do
and
into
her
which
was
the
very
room
which
i
suspected
it
lay
between
that
and
her
bedroom
and
i
was
determined
to
see
which
they
laid
me
on
a
couch
i
motioned
for
air
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
window
and
you
had
your
chance
how
did
that
help
you
it
was
when
a
woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
fire
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
most
it
is
a
perfectly
overpowering
impulse
and
i
have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
it
in
the
case
of
the
darlington
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
me
and
also
in
the
arnsworth
castle
business
a
married
woman
grabs
at
her
baby
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
now
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
of
she
would
rush
to
secure
it
the
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
done
the
smoke
and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
steel
she
responded
beautifully
the
photograph
is
in
a
recess
behind
a
sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
she
was
there
in
an
instant
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
she
it
out
when
i
cried
out
that
it
was
a
false
alarm
she
replaced
it
glanced
at
the
rocket
rushed
from
the
room
and
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
rose
and
making
my
excuses
escaped
from
the
house
i
hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
once
but
the
coachman
had
come
in
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
wait
a
little
may
ruin
all
and
now
i
asked
our
quest
is
practically
finished
i
shall
call
with
the
king
and
with
you
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
we
will
be
shown
into
the
to
wait
for
the
lady
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
photograph
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
majesty
to
regain
it
with
his
own
hands
and
when
will
you
call
at
eight
in
the
morning
she
will
not
be
up
so
that
we
shall
have
a
clear
field
besides
we
must
be
prompt
for
this
marriage
may
mean
a
complete
change
in
her
life
and
habits
i
must
wire
to
the
king
without
delay
we
had
reached
baker
street
and
had
stopped
at
the
door
he
was
searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
said
mister
sherlock
holmes
there
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
time
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from
a
slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
by
i
heard
that
voice
before
said
holmes
staring
down
the
dimly
lit
street
now
i
wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
been
iii
i
slept
at
baker
street
that
night
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the
king
of
bohemia
rushed
into
the
room
you
have
really
got
it
he
cried
grasping
sherlock
holmes
by
either
shoulder
and
looking
eagerly
into
his
face
not
yet
but
you
have
hopes
i
have
hopes
then
come
i
am
all
impatience
to
be
gone
we
must
have
a
cab
no
my
brougham
is
waiting
then
that
will
simplify
matters
we
descended
and
started
off
once
more
for
briony
lodge
irene
adler
is
married
remarked
holmes
married
when
yesterday
but
to
whom
to
an
english
lawyer
named
norton
but
she
could
not
love
him
i
am
in
hopes
that
she
does
and
why
in
hopes
because
it
would
spare
your
majesty
all
fear
of
future
annoyance
if
the
lady
loves
her
husband
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
if
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interfere
with
your
majesty
plan
it
is
true
and
yet
well
i
wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
station
what
a
queen
she
would
have
made
he
relapsed
into
a
moody
silence
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
serpentine
avenue
the
door
of
briony
lodge
was
open
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
steps
she
watched
us
with
a
sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
brougham
sherlock
holmes
i
believe
said
she
i
am
holmes
answered
my
companion
looking
at
her
with
a
questioning
and
rather
startled
gaze
indeed
my
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
call
she
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
train
from
charing
cross
for
the
continent
what
sherlock
holmes
staggered
back
white
with
chagrin
and
surprise
do
you
mean
that
she
has
left
england
never
to
return
and
the
papers
asked
the
king
hoarsely
all
is
lost
we
shall
see
he
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
followed
by
the
king
and
myself
the
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
every
direction
with
dismantled
shelves
and
open
drawers
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
flight
holmes
rushed
at
the
tore
back
a
small
sliding
shutter
and
plunging
in
his
hand
pulled
out
a
photograph
and
a
letter
the
photograph
was
of
irene
adler
herself
in
evening
dress
the
letter
was
superscribed
to
sherlock
holmes
esq
to
be
left
till
called
for
my
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
together
it
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
way
my
dear
sherlock
holmes
you
really
did
it
very
well
you
took
me
in
completely
until
after
the
alarm
of
fire
i
had
not
a
suspicion
but
then
when
i
found
how
i
had
betrayed
myself
i
began
to
think
i
had
been
warned
against
you
months
ago
i
had
been
told
that
if
the
king
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
you
and
your
address
had
been
given
me
yet
with
all
this
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
know
even
after
i
became
suspicious
i
found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such
a
dear
kind
old
clergyman
but
you
know
i
have
been
trained
as
an
actress
myself
male
costume
is
nothing
new
to
me
i
often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
gives
i
sent
john
the
coachman
to
watch
you
ran
up
stairs
got
into
my
as
i
call
them
and
came
down
just
as
you
departed
well
i
followed
you
to
your
door
and
so
made
sure
that
i
was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
sherlock
holmes
then
i
rather
imprudently
wished
you
and
started
for
the
temple
to
see
my
husband
we
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
flight
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
antagonist
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
as
to
the
photograph
your
client
may
rest
in
peace
i
love
and
am
loved
by
a
better
man
than
he
the
king
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
wronged
i
keep
it
only
to
safeguard
myself
and
to
preserve
a
weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
future
i
leave
a
photograph
which
he
might
care
to
possess
and
i
remain
dear
sherlock
holmes
very
truly
yours
irene
norton
née
adler
what
a
woman
oh
what
a
woman
cried
the
king
of
bohemia
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
epistle
did
i
not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
was
would
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
queen
is
it
not
a
pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
level
from
what
i
have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on
a
very
different
level
to
your
majesty
said
holmes
coldly
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
majesty
business
to
a
more
successful
conclusion
on
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
cried
the
king
nothing
could
be
more
successful
i
know
that
her
word
is
inviolate
the
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
fire
i
am
glad
to
hear
your
majesty
say
so
i
am
immensely
indebted
to
you
pray
tell
me
in
what
way
i
can
reward
you
this
ring
he
slipped
an
emerald
snake
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
your
majesty
has
something
which
i
should
value
even
more
highly
said
holmes
you
have
but
to
name
it
this
photograph
the
king
stared
at
him
in
amazement
irene
photograph
he
cried
certainly
if
you
wish
it
i
thank
your
majesty
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
very
he
bowed
and
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
king
had
stretched
out
to
him
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
chambers
and
that
was
how
a
great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
bohemia
and
how
the
best
plans
of
sherlock
holmes
were
beaten
by
a
woman
wit
he
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
women
but
i
have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
late
and
when
he
speaks
of
irene
adler
or
when
he
refers
to
her
photograph
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of
the
woman
adventure
ii
the
league
i
had
called
upon
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with
a
very
stout
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
hair
with
an
apology
for
my
intrusion
i
was
about
to
withdraw
when
holmes
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
you
could
not
possibly
have
come
at
a
better
time
my
dear
watson
he
said
cordially
i
was
afraid
that
you
were
engaged
so
i
am
very
much
so
then
i
can
wait
in
the
next
room
not
at
all
this
gentleman
wilson
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
cases
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
also
the
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
a
bob
of
greeting
with
a
quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
eyes
try
the
settee
said
holmes
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
together
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
moods
i
know
my
dear
watson
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
life
you
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
chronicle
and
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
adventures
your
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me
i
observed
you
will
remember
that
i
remarked
the
other
day
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
miss
mary
sutherland
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
itself
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
imagination
a
proposition
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
doubting
you
did
doctor
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
view
for
otherwise
i
shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
right
now
jabez
wilson
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
morning
and
to
begin
a
narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which
i
have
listened
to
for
some
time
you
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
crimes
and
occasionally
indeed
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
committed
as
far
as
i
have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
not
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that
i
have
ever
listened
to
perhaps
wilson
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
narrative
i
ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
watson
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
lips
as
a
rule
when
i
have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
events
i
am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
memory
in
the
present
instance
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
are
to
the
best
of
my
belief
unique
the
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
a
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
as
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavoured
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance
i
did
not
gain
very
much
however
by
my
inspection
our
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
british
tradesman
obese
pompous
and
slow
he
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd
check
trousers
a
not
black
unbuttoned
in
the
front
and
a
drab
waistcoat
with
a
heavy
brassy
albert
chain
and
a
square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
ornament
a
frayed
and
a
faded
brown
overcoat
with
a
wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon
a
chair
beside
him
altogether
look
as
i
would
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
head
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
features
sherlock
holmes
quick
eye
took
in
my
occupation
and
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
glances
beyond
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
labour
that
he
takes
snuff
that
he
is
a
freemason
that
he
has
been
in
china
and
that
he
has
done
a
considerable
amount
of
writing
lately
i
can
deduce
nothing
else
jabez
wilson
started
up
in
his
chair
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
paper
but
his
eyes
upon
my
companion
how
in
the
name
of
did
you
know
all
that
mr
holmes
he
asked
how
did
you
know
for
example
that
i
did
manual
labour
it
as
true
as
gospel
for
i
began
as
a
carpenter
your
hands
my
dear
sir
your
right
hand
is
quite
a
size
larger
than
your
left
you
have
worked
with
it
and
the
muscles
are
more
developed
well
the
snuff
then
and
the
freemasonry
i
wo
insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how
i
read
that
especially
as
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
order
you
use
an
breastpin
ah
of
course
i
forgot
that
but
the
writing
what
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
inches
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
desk
well
but
china
the
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
china
i
have
made
a
small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
subject
that
trick
of
staining
the
fishes
scales
of
a
delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
china
when
in
addition
i
see
a
chinese
coin
hanging
from
your
the
matter
becomes
even
more
simple
jabez
wilson
laughed
heavily
well
i
never
said
he
i
thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
clever
but
i
see
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
all
i
begin
to
think
watson
said
holmes
that
i
make
a
mistake
in
explaining
ignotum
pro
magnifico
you
know
and
my
poor
little
reputation
such
as
it
is
will
suffer
shipwreck
if
i
am
so
candid
can
you
not
find
the
advertisement
mr
wilson
yes
i
have
got
it
now
he
answered
with
his
thick
red
finger
planted
halfway
down
the
column
here
it
is
this
is
what
began
it
all
you
just
read
it
for
yourself
sir
i
took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
as
follows
to
the
league
on
account
of
the
bequest
of
the
late
ezekiah
hopkins
of
lebanon
pennsylvania
there
is
now
another
vacancy
open
which
entitles
a
member
of
the
league
to
a
salary
of
pounds
a
week
for
purely
nominal
services
all
men
who
are
sound
in
body
and
mind
and
above
the
age
of
years
are
eligible
apply
in
person
on
monday
at
eleven
to
duncan
ross
at
the
offices
of
the
league
pope
court
fleet
street
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
i
ejaculated
after
i
had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
announcement
holmes
chuckled
and
wriggled
in
his
chair
as
was
his
habit
when
in
high
spirits
it
is
a
little
off
the
beaten
track
is
it
said
he
and
now
wilson
off
you
go
at
scratch
and
tell
us
all
about
yourself
your
household
and
the
effect
which
this
advertisement
had
upon
your
fortunes
you
will
first
make
a
note
doctor
of
the
paper
and
the
date
it
is
the
morning
chronicle
of
april
just
two
months
ago
very
good
now
mr
wilson
well
it
is
just
as
i
have
been
telling
you
sherlock
holmes
said
jabez
wilson
mopping
his
forehead
i
have
a
small
pawnbroker
business
at
coburg
square
near
the
city
it
not
a
very
large
affair
and
of
late
years
it
has
not
done
more
than
just
give
me
a
living
i
used
to
be
able
to
keep
two
assistants
but
now
i
only
keep
one
and
i
would
have
a
job
to
pay
him
but
that
he
is
willing
to
come
for
half
wages
so
as
to
learn
the
business
what
is
the
name
of
this
obliging
youth
asked
sherlock
holmes
his
name
is
vincent
spaulding
and
he
not
such
a
youth
either
it
hard
to
say
his
age
i
should
not
wish
a
smarter
assistant
holmes
and
i
know
very
well
that
he
could
better
himself
and
earn
twice
what
i
am
able
to
give
him
but
after
all
if
he
is
satisfied
why
should
i
put
ideas
in
his
head
why
indeed
you
seem
most
fortunate
in
having
an
employé
who
comes
under
the
full
market
price
it
is
not
a
common
experience
among
employers
in
this
age
i
do
know
that
your
assistant
is
not
as
remarkable
as
your
advertisement
oh
he
has
his
faults
too
said
wilson
never
was
such
a
fellow
for
photography
snapping
away
with
a
camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
mind
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like
a
rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
pictures
that
is
his
main
fault
but
on
the
whole
he
a
good
worker
there
no
vice
in
him
he
is
still
with
you
i
presume
yes
sir
he
and
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
does
a
bit
of
simple
cooking
and
keeps
the
place
clean
that
all
i
have
in
the
house
for
i
am
a
widower
and
never
had
any
family
we
live
very
quietly
sir
the
three
of
us
and
we
keep
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
pay
our
debts
if
we
do
nothing
more
the
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
advertisement
spaulding
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
weeks
with
this
very
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
says
wish
to
the
lord
wilson
that
i
was
a
man
that
i
asks
says
he
another
vacancy
on
the
league
of
the
men
it
worth
quite
a
little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
it
and
i
understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
men
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
wits
end
what
to
do
with
the
money
if
my
hair
would
only
change
colour
a
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
into
what
is
it
then
i
asked
you
see
holmes
i
am
a
very
man
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
it
i
was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
in
that
way
i
did
know
much
of
what
was
going
on
outside
and
i
was
always
glad
of
a
bit
of
news
you
never
heard
of
the
league
of
the
men
he
asked
with
his
eyes
open
i
wonder
at
that
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
vacancies
what
are
they
worth
i
asked
merely
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
but
the
work
is
slight
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with
one
other
occupations
well
you
can
easily
think
that
that
made
me
prick
up
my
ears
for
the
business
has
not
been
for
some
years
and
an
extra
couple
of
hundred
would
have
been
very
handy
me
all
about
it
said
i
said
he
showing
me
the
advertisement
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
league
has
a
vacancy
and
there
is
the
address
where
you
should
apply
for
particulars
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
league
was
founded
by
an
american
millionaire
ezekiah
hopkins
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
ways
he
was
himself
and
he
had
a
great
sympathy
for
all
men
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
trustees
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
colour
from
all
i
hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
do
said
i
would
be
millions
of
men
who
would
apply
so
many
as
you
might
think
he
answered
see
it
is
really
confined
to
londoners
and
to
grown
men
this
american
had
started
from
london
when
he
was
young
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town
a
good
turn
then
again
i
have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
red
or
dark
red
or
anything
but
real
bright
blazing
fiery
red
now
if
you
cared
to
apply
wilson
you
would
just
walk
in
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
now
it
is
a
fact
gentlemen
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
that
my
hair
is
of
a
very
full
and
rich
tint
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter
i
stood
as
good
a
chance
as
any
man
that
i
had
ever
met
vincent
spaulding
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that
i
thought
he
might
prove
useful
so
i
just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
me
he
was
very
willing
to
have
a
holiday
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
advertisement
i
never
hope
to
see
such
a
sight
as
that
again
holmes
from
north
south
east
and
west
every
man
who
had
a
shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
advertisement
fleet
street
was
choked
with
folk
and
pope
court
looked
like
a
coster
orange
barrow
i
should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
advertisement
every
shade
of
colour
they
were
straw
lemon
orange
brick
liver
clay
but
as
spaulding
said
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
tint
when
i
saw
how
many
were
waiting
i
would
have
given
it
up
in
despair
but
spaulding
would
not
hear
of
it
how
he
did
it
i
could
not
imagine
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
crowd
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
office
there
was
a
double
stream
upon
the
stair
some
going
up
in
hope
and
some
coming
back
dejected
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
office
your
experience
has
been
a
most
entertaining
one
remarked
holmes
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with
a
huge
pinch
of
snuff
pray
continue
your
very
interesting
statement
there
was
nothing
in
the
office
but
a
couple
of
wooden
chairs
and
a
deal
table
behind
which
sat
a
small
man
with
a
head
that
was
even
redder
than
mine
he
said
a
few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
up
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
them
getting
a
vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such
a
very
easy
matter
after
all
however
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
others
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
entered
so
that
he
might
have
a
private
word
with
us
is
jabez
wilson
said
my
assistant
he
is
willing
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
league
he
is
admirably
suited
for
it
the
other
answered
has
every
requirement
i
can
not
recall
when
i
have
seen
anything
so
fine
he
took
a
step
backward
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until
i
felt
quite
bashful
then
suddenly
he
plunged
forward
wrung
my
hand
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
success
would
be
injustice
to
hesitate
said
he
will
however
i
am
sure
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
precaution
with
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
hands
and
tugged
until
i
yelled
with
the
pain
is
water
in
your
eyes
said
he
as
he
released
me
perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
but
we
have
to
be
careful
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
paint
i
could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler
wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
nature
he
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
filled
a
groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
below
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not
a
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
manager
name
said
he
duncan
ross
and
i
am
myself
one
of
the
pensioners
upon
the
fund
left
by
our
noble
benefactor
are
you
a
married
man
wilson
have
you
a
family
i
answered
that
i
had
not
his
face
fell
immediately
me
he
said
gravely
is
very
serious
indeed
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
the
fund
was
of
course
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
as
well
as
for
their
maintenance
it
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
a
bachelor
my
face
lengthened
at
this
holmes
for
i
thought
that
i
was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
all
but
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
right
the
case
of
another
said
he
objection
might
be
fatal
but
we
must
stretch
a
point
in
favour
of
a
man
with
such
a
head
of
hair
as
yours
when
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
duties
it
is
a
little
awkward
for
i
have
a
business
already
said
i
never
mind
about
that
mr
wilson
said
vincent
spaulding
should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
you
would
be
the
hours
i
asked
to
two
now
a
pawnbroker
business
is
mostly
done
of
an
evening
holmes
especially
thursday
and
friday
evening
which
is
just
before
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn
a
little
in
the
mornings
besides
i
knew
that
my
assistant
was
a
good
man
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
up
would
suit
me
very
well
said
i
the
pay
pounds
a
week
the
work
purely
nominal
do
you
call
purely
nominal
you
have
to
be
in
the
office
or
at
least
in
the
building
the
whole
time
if
you
leave
you
forfeit
your
whole
position
forever
the
will
is
very
clear
upon
that
point
you
do
comply
with
the
conditions
if
you
budge
from
the
office
during
that
time
only
four
hours
a
day
and
i
should
not
think
of
leaving
said
i
excuse
will
avail
said
duncan
ross
sickness
nor
business
nor
anything
else
there
you
must
stay
or
you
lose
your
billet
the
work
to
copy
out
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
there
is
the
first
volume
of
it
in
that
press
you
must
find
your
own
ink
pens
and
but
we
provide
this
table
and
chair
will
you
be
ready
i
answered
jabez
wilson
and
let
me
congratulate
you
once
more
on
the
important
position
which
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
gain
he
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and
i
went
home
with
my
assistant
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
i
was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
fortune
well
i
thought
over
the
matter
all
day
and
by
evening
i
was
in
low
spirits
again
for
i
had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
fraud
though
what
its
object
might
be
i
could
not
imagine
it
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such
a
will
or
that
they
would
pay
such
a
sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
britannica
vincent
spaulding
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
up
but
by
bedtime
i
had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
thing
however
in
the
morning
i
determined
to
have
a
look
at
it
anyhow
so
i
bought
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
and
with
a
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
i
started
off
for
pope
court
well
to
my
surprise
and
delight
everything
was
as
right
as
possible
the
table
was
set
out
ready
for
me
and
duncan
ross
was
there
to
see
that
i
got
fairly
to
work
he
started
me
off
upon
the
letter
a
and
then
he
left
me
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
me
at
two
he
bade
me
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that
i
had
written
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
me
this
went
on
day
after
day
holmes
and
on
saturday
the
manager
came
in
and
planked
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week
work
it
was
the
same
next
week
and
the
same
the
week
after
every
morning
i
was
there
at
ten
and
every
afternoon
i
left
at
two
by
degrees
duncan
ross
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of
a
morning
and
then
after
a
time
he
did
not
come
in
at
all
still
of
course
i
never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
instant
for
i
was
not
sure
when
he
might
come
and
the
billet
was
such
a
good
one
and
suited
me
so
well
that
i
would
not
risk
the
loss
of
it
eight
weeks
passed
away
like
this
and
i
had
written
about
abbots
and
archery
and
armour
and
architecture
and
attica
and
hoped
with
diligence
that
i
might
get
on
to
the
b
before
very
long
it
cost
me
something
in
foolscap
and
i
had
pretty
nearly
filled
a
shelf
with
my
writings
and
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
end
to
an
end
yes
sir
and
no
later
than
this
morning
i
went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten
but
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
with
a
little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with
a
tack
here
it
is
and
you
can
read
for
yourself
he
held
up
a
piece
of
white
cardboard
about
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
it
read
in
this
fashion
the
league
is
dissolved
october
sherlock
holmes
and
i
surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
it
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
overtopped
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
laughter
i
can
not
see
that
there
is
anything
very
funny
cried
our
client
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
head
if
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
me
i
can
go
elsewhere
no
no
cried
holmes
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
risen
i
really
would
miss
your
case
for
the
world
it
is
most
refreshingly
unusual
but
there
is
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
something
just
a
little
funny
about
it
pray
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
door
i
was
staggered
sir
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
then
i
called
at
the
offices
round
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
it
finally
i
went
to
the
landlord
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
and
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
league
he
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
body
then
i
asked
him
who
duncan
ross
was
he
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
him
said
i
gentleman
at
no
the
man
said
he
name
was
william
morris
he
was
a
solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as
a
temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
ready
he
moved
out
yesterday
could
i
find
him
at
his
new
offices
he
did
tell
me
the
address
yes
king
edward
street
near
st
paul
i
started
off
holmes
but
when
i
got
to
that
address
it
was
a
manufactory
of
artificial
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
william
morris
or
duncan
ross
and
what
did
you
do
then
asked
holmes
i
went
home
to
square
and
i
took
the
advice
of
my
assistant
but
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
way
he
could
only
say
that
if
i
waited
i
should
hear
by
post
but
that
was
not
quite
good
enough
holmes
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
such
a
place
without
a
struggle
so
as
i
had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
it
i
came
right
away
to
you
and
you
did
very
wisely
said
holmes
your
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
one
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
appear
grave
enough
said
jabez
wilson
why
i
have
lost
four
pound
a
week
as
far
as
you
are
personally
concerned
remarked
holmes
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
league
on
the
contrary
you
are
as
i
understand
richer
by
some
pounds
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter
a
you
have
lost
nothing
by
them
no
sir
but
i
want
to
find
out
about
them
and
who
they
are
and
what
their
object
was
in
playing
this
prank
if
it
was
a
prank
upon
me
it
was
a
pretty
expensive
joke
for
them
for
it
cost
them
two
and
thirty
pounds
we
shall
endeavour
to
clear
up
these
points
for
you
and
first
one
or
two
questions
wilson
this
assistant
of
yours
who
first
called
your
attention
to
the
advertisement
how
long
had
he
been
with
you
about
a
month
then
how
did
he
come
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
was
he
the
only
applicant
no
i
had
a
dozen
why
did
you
pick
him
because
he
was
handy
and
would
come
cheap
at
in
fact
yes
what
is
he
like
this
vincent
spaulding
small
very
quick
in
his
ways
no
hair
on
his
face
though
he
not
short
of
thirty
has
a
white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
forehead
holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
excitement
i
thought
as
much
said
he
have
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
earrings
yes
sir
he
told
me
that
a
gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was
a
lad
hum
said
holmes
sinking
back
in
deep
thought
he
is
still
with
you
oh
yes
sir
i
have
only
just
left
him
and
has
your
business
been
attended
to
in
your
absence
nothing
to
complain
of
sir
there
never
very
much
to
do
of
a
morning
that
will
do
wilson
i
shall
be
happy
to
give
you
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
is
saturday
and
i
hope
that
by
monday
we
may
come
to
a
conclusion
well
watson
said
holmes
when
our
visitor
had
left
us
what
do
you
make
of
it
all
i
make
nothing
of
it
i
answered
frankly
it
is
a
most
mysterious
business
as
a
rule
said
holmes
the
more
bizarre
a
thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
be
it
is
your
commonplace
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
puzzling
just
as
a
commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
identify
but
i
must
be
prompt
over
this
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
i
asked
to
smoke
he
answered
it
is
quite
a
three
pipe
problem
and
i
beg
that
you
wo
speak
to
me
for
fifty
minutes
he
curled
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
nose
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
bird
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
and
indeed
was
nodding
myself
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
sarasate
plays
at
the
james
hall
this
afternoon
he
remarked
what
do
you
think
watson
could
your
patients
spare
you
for
a
few
hours
i
have
nothing
to
do
my
practice
is
never
very
absorbing
then
put
on
your
hat
and
come
i
am
going
through
the
city
first
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
way
i
observe
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
german
music
on
the
programme
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
italian
or
french
it
is
introspective
and
i
want
to
introspect
come
along
we
travelled
by
the
underground
as
far
as
aldersgate
and
a
short
walk
took
us
to
square
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
morning
it
was
a
poky
little
place
where
four
lines
of
dingy
brick
houses
looked
out
into
a
small
enclosure
where
a
lawn
of
weedy
grass
and
a
few
clumps
of
faded
made
a
hard
fight
against
a
and
uncongenial
atmosphere
three
gilt
balls
and
a
brown
board
with
jabez
wilson
in
white
letters
upon
a
corner
house
announced
the
place
where
our
client
carried
on
his
business
sherlock
holmes
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
over
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
lids
then
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street
and
then
down
again
to
the
corner
still
looking
keenly
at
the
houses
finally
he
returned
to
the
pawnbroker
and
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
times
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
it
was
instantly
opened
by
a
young
fellow
who
asked
him
to
step
in
thank
you
said
holmes
i
only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
strand
third
right
fourth
left
answered
the
assistant
promptly
closing
the
door
smart
fellow
that
observed
holmes
as
we
walked
away
he
is
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
london
and
for
daring
i
am
not
sure
that
he
has
not
a
claim
to
be
third
i
have
known
something
of
him
before
evidently
said
i
wilson
assistant
counts
for
a
good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
league
i
am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
him
not
him
what
then
the
knees
of
his
trousers
and
what
did
you
see
what
i
expected
to
see
why
did
you
beat
the
pavement
my
dear
doctor
this
is
a
time
for
observation
not
for
talk
we
are
spies
in
an
enemy
country
we
know
something
of
square
let
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
it
the
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
square
presented
as
great
a
contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of
a
picture
does
to
the
back
it
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
city
to
the
north
and
west
the
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in
a
double
tide
inward
and
outward
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
pedestrians
it
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
quitted
let
me
see
said
holmes
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
line
i
should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
here
it
is
a
hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
london
there
is
mortimer
the
tobacconist
the
little
newspaper
shop
the
coburg
branch
of
the
city
and
suburban
bank
the
vegetarian
restaurant
and
mcfarlane
depot
that
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
block
and
now
doctor
we
done
our
work
so
it
time
we
had
some
play
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
then
off
to
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
harmony
and
there
are
no
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
conundrums
my
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
being
himself
not
only
a
very
capable
performer
but
a
composer
of
no
ordinary
merit
all
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
happiness
gently
waving
his
long
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
music
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
languid
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
holmes
the
holmes
the
relentless
criminal
agent
as
it
was
possible
to
conceive
in
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
itself
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
represented
as
i
have
often
thought
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
him
the
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
energy
and
as
i
knew
well
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
when
for
days
on
end
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
editions
then
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
intuition
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on
a
man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
mortals
when
i
saw
him
that
afternoon
so
enwrapped
in
the
music
at
james
hall
i
felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
down
you
want
to
go
home
no
doubt
doctor
he
remarked
as
we
emerged
yes
it
would
be
as
well
and
i
have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
hours
this
business
at
coburg
square
is
serious
why
serious
a
considerable
crime
is
in
contemplation
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
it
but
being
saturday
rather
complicates
matters
i
shall
want
your
help
at
what
time
ten
will
be
early
enough
i
shall
be
at
baker
street
at
ten
very
well
and
i
say
doctor
there
may
be
some
little
danger
so
kindly
put
your
army
revolver
in
your
pocket
he
waved
his
hand
turned
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
crowd
i
trust
that
i
am
not
more
dense
than
my
neighbours
but
i
was
always
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
sherlock
holmes
here
i
had
heard
what
he
had
heard
i
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
happen
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
grotesque
as
i
drove
home
to
my
house
in
kensington
i
thought
over
it
all
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
copier
of
the
encyclopaedia
down
to
the
visit
to
square
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
me
what
was
this
nocturnal
expedition
and
why
should
i
go
armed
where
were
we
going
and
what
were
we
to
do
i
had
the
hint
from
holmes
that
this
pawnbroker
assistant
was
a
formidable
man
a
man
who
might
play
a
deep
game
i
tried
to
puzzle
it
out
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
explanation
it
was
a
nine
when
i
started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
park
and
so
through
oxford
street
to
baker
street
two
hansoms
were
standing
at
the
door
and
as
i
entered
the
passage
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
above
on
entering
his
room
i
found
holmes
in
animated
conversation
with
two
men
one
of
whom
i
recognised
as
peter
jones
the
official
police
agent
while
the
other
was
a
long
thin
man
with
a
very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
ha
our
party
is
complete
said
holmes
buttoning
up
his
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
rack
watson
i
think
you
know
jones
of
scotland
yard
let
me
introduce
you
to
merryweather
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
adventure
we
hunting
in
couples
again
doctor
you
see
said
jones
in
his
consequential
way
our
friend
here
is
a
wonderful
man
for
starting
a
chase
all
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
down
i
hope
a
wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
chase
observed
merryweather
gloomily
you
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
holmes
sir
said
the
police
agent
loftily
he
has
his
own
little
methods
which
are
if
he
wo
mind
my
saying
so
just
a
little
too
theoretical
and
fantastic
but
he
has
the
makings
of
a
detective
in
him
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
twice
as
in
that
business
of
the
sholto
murder
and
the
agra
treasure
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
force
oh
if
you
say
so
jones
it
is
all
right
said
the
stranger
with
deference
still
i
confess
that
i
miss
my
rubber
it
is
the
first
saturday
night
for
years
that
i
have
not
had
my
rubber
i
think
you
will
find
said
sherlock
holmes
that
you
will
play
for
a
higher
stake
than
you
have
ever
done
yet
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
exciting
for
you
merryweather
the
stake
will
be
some
pounds
and
for
you
jones
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
hands
john
clay
the
murderer
thief
smasher
and
forger
he
a
young
man
merryweather
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
and
i
would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
london
he
a
remarkable
man
is
young
john
clay
his
grandfather
was
a
royal
duke
and
he
himself
has
been
to
eton
and
oxford
his
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
fingers
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
turn
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
himself
he
crack
a
crib
in
scotland
one
week
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
cornwall
the
next
i
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
yet
i
hope
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
i
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
john
clay
and
i
agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
it
is
past
ten
however
and
quite
time
that
we
started
if
you
two
will
take
the
first
hansom
watson
and
i
will
follow
in
the
second
sherlock
holmes
was
not
very
communicative
during
the
long
drive
and
lay
back
in
the
cab
humming
the
tunes
which
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon
we
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
streets
until
we
emerged
into
farrington
street
we
are
close
there
now
my
friend
remarked
this
fellow
merryweather
is
a
bank
director
and
personally
interested
in
the
matter
i
thought
it
as
well
to
have
jones
with
us
also
he
is
not
a
bad
fellow
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
profession
he
has
one
positive
virtue
he
is
as
brave
as
a
bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as
a
lobster
if
he
gets
his
claws
upon
anyone
here
we
are
and
they
are
waiting
for
us
we
had
reached
the
same
crowded
thoroughfare
in
which
we
had
found
ourselves
in
the
morning
our
cabs
were
dismissed
and
following
the
guidance
of
merryweather
we
passed
down
a
narrow
passage
and
through
a
side
door
which
he
opened
for
us
within
there
was
a
small
corridor
which
ended
in
a
very
massive
iron
gate
this
also
was
opened
and
led
down
a
flight
of
winding
stone
steps
which
terminated
at
another
formidable
gate
merryweather
stopped
to
light
a
lantern
and
then
conducted
us
down
a
dark
passage
and
so
after
opening
a
third
door
into
a
huge
vault
or
cellar
which
was
piled
all
round
with
crates
and
massive
boxes
you
are
not
very
vulnerable
from
above
holmes
remarked
as
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
gazed
about
him
nor
from
below
said
merryweather
striking
his
stick
upon
the
flags
which
lined
the
floor
why
dear
me
it
sounds
quite
hollow
he
remarked
looking
up
in
surprise
i
must
really
ask
you
to
be
a
little
more
quiet
said
holmes
severely
you
have
already
imperilled
the
whole
success
of
our
expedition
might
i
beg
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
upon
one
of
those
boxes
and
not
to
interfere
the
solemn
merryweather
perched
himself
upon
a
crate
with
a
very
injured
expression
upon
his
face
while
holmes
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and
with
the
lantern
and
a
magnifying
lens
began
to
examine
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
stones
a
few
seconds
sufficed
to
satisfy
him
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
put
his
glass
in
his
pocket
we
have
at
least
an
hour
before
us
he
remarked
for
they
can
hardly
take
any
steps
until
the
good
pawnbroker
is
safely
in
bed
then
they
will
not
lose
a
minute
for
the
sooner
they
do
their
work
the
longer
time
they
will
have
for
their
escape
we
are
at
present
doctor
as
no
doubt
you
have
divined
in
the
cellar
of
the
city
branch
of
one
of
the
principal
london
banks
merryweather
is
the
chairman
of
directors
and
he
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
more
daring
criminals
of
london
should
take
a
considerable
interest
in
this
cellar
at
present
it
is
our
french
gold
whispered
the
director
we
have
had
several
warnings
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
upon
it
your
french
gold
yes
we
had
occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose
napoleons
from
the
bank
of
france
it
has
become
known
that
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
unpack
the
money
and
that
it
is
still
lying
in
our
cellar
the
crate
upon
which
i
sit
contains
napoleons
packed
between
layers
of
lead
foil
our
reserve
of
bullion
is
much
larger
at
present
than
is
usually
kept
in
a
single
branch
office
and
the
directors
have
had
misgivings
upon
the
subject
which
were
very
well
justified
observed
holmes
and
now
it
is
time
that
we
arranged
our
little
plans
i
expect
that
within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to
a
head
in
the
meantime
merryweather
we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
lantern
and
sit
in
the
dark
i
am
afraid
so
i
had
brought
a
pack
of
cards
in
my
pocket
and
i
thought
that
as
we
were
a
partie
carrée
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
all
but
i
see
that
the
enemy
preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
can
not
risk
the
presence
of
a
light
and
first
of
all
we
must
choose
our
positions
these
are
daring
men
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at
a
disadvantage
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
careful
i
shall
stand
behind
this
crate
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
those
then
when
i
flash
a
light
upon
them
close
in
swiftly
if
they
fire
watson
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
down
i
placed
my
revolver
cocked
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which
i
crouched
holmes
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
darkness
such
an
absolute
darkness
as
i
have
never
before
experienced
the
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there
ready
to
flash
out
at
a
moment
notice
to
me
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
expectancy
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault
they
have
but
one
retreat
whispered
holmes
that
is
back
through
the
house
into
square
i
hope
that
you
have
done
what
i
asked
you
jones
i
have
an
inspector
and
two
officers
waiting
at
the
front
door
then
we
have
stopped
all
the
holes
and
now
we
must
be
silent
and
wait
what
a
time
it
seemed
from
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and
a
quarter
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
us
my
limbs
were
weary
and
stiff
for
i
feared
to
change
my
position
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
tension
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
i
could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
companions
but
i
could
distinguish
the
deeper
heavier
of
the
bulky
jones
from
the
thin
sighing
note
of
the
bank
director
from
my
position
i
could
look
over
the
case
in
the
direction
of
the
floor
suddenly
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of
a
light
at
first
it
was
but
a
lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
pavement
then
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became
a
yellow
line
and
then
without
any
warning
or
sound
a
gash
seemed
to
open
and
a
hand
appeared
a
white
almost
womanly
hand
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
light
for
a
minute
or
more
the
hand
with
its
writhing
fingers
protruded
out
of
the
floor
then
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
appeared
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked
a
chink
between
the
stones
its
disappearance
however
was
but
momentary
with
a
rending
tearing
sound
one
of
the
broad
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left
a
square
gaping
hole
through
which
streamed
the
light
of
a
lantern
over
the
edge
there
peeped
a
boyish
face
which
looked
keenly
about
it
and
then
with
a
hand
on
either
side
of
the
aperture
drew
itself
and
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
edge
in
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him
a
companion
lithe
and
small
like
himself
with
a
pale
face
and
a
shock
of
very
red
hair
it
all
clear
he
whispered
have
you
the
chisel
and
the
bags
great
scott
jump
archie
jump
and
i
swing
for
it
sherlock
holmes
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
collar
the
other
dived
down
the
hole
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
jones
clutched
at
his
skirts
the
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
but
holmes
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man
wrist
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
floor
it
no
use
john
clay
said
holmes
blandly
you
have
no
chance
at
all
so
i
see
the
other
answered
with
the
utmost
coolness
i
fancy
that
my
pal
is
all
right
though
i
see
you
have
got
his
there
are
three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
said
holmes
oh
indeed
you
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
completely
i
must
compliment
you
and
i
you
holmes
answered
your
idea
was
very
new
and
effective
you
see
your
pal
again
presently
said
jones
he
quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than
i
am
just
hold
out
while
i
fix
the
derbies
i
beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy
hands
remarked
our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
wrists
you
may
not
be
aware
that
i
have
royal
blood
in
my
veins
have
the
goodness
also
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
and
all
right
said
jones
with
a
stare
and
a
snigger
well
would
you
please
sir
march
upstairs
where
we
can
get
a
cab
to
carry
your
highness
to
the
that
is
better
said
john
clay
serenely
he
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
detective
really
holmes
said
merryweather
as
we
followed
them
from
the
cellar
i
do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
you
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my
experience
i
have
had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
john
clay
said
holmes
i
have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
matter
which
i
shall
expect
the
bank
to
refund
but
beyond
that
i
am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
unique
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
league
you
see
watson
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
baker
street
it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
league
and
the
copying
of
the
must
be
to
get
this
not
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for
a
number
of
hours
every
day
it
was
a
curious
way
of
managing
it
but
really
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
a
better
the
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
clay
ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
accomplice
hair
the
pounds
a
week
was
a
lure
which
must
draw
him
and
what
was
it
to
them
who
were
playing
for
thousands
they
put
in
the
advertisement
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
office
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
it
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
week
from
the
time
that
i
heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
wages
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
situation
but
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
was
had
there
been
women
in
the
house
i
should
have
suspected
a
mere
vulgar
intrigue
that
however
was
out
of
the
question
the
man
business
was
a
small
one
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
preparations
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
at
it
must
then
be
something
out
of
the
house
what
could
it
be
i
thought
of
the
fondness
for
photography
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
cellar
the
cellar
there
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
clue
then
i
made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that
i
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
london
he
was
doing
something
in
the
cellar
something
which
took
many
hours
a
day
for
months
on
end
what
could
it
be
once
more
i
could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running
a
tunnel
to
some
other
building
so
far
i
had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
action
i
surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
stick
i
was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
behind
it
was
not
in
front
then
i
rang
the
bell
and
as
i
hoped
the
assistant
answered
it
we
have
had
some
skirmishes
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
before
i
hardly
looked
at
his
face
his
knees
were
what
i
wished
to
see
you
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
worn
wrinkled
and
stained
they
were
they
spoke
of
those
hours
of
burrowing
the
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
for
i
walked
round
the
corner
saw
the
city
and
suburban
bank
abutted
on
our
friend
premises
and
felt
that
i
had
solved
my
problem
when
you
drove
home
after
the
concert
i
called
upon
scotland
yard
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
directors
with
the
result
that
you
have
seen
and
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
i
asked
well
when
they
closed
their
league
offices
that
was
a
sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
jabez
wilson
presence
in
other
words
that
they
had
completed
their
tunnel
but
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
soon
as
it
might
be
discovered
or
the
bullion
might
be
removed
saturday
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
day
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
escape
for
all
these
reasons
i
expected
them
to
come
you
reasoned
it
out
beautifully
i
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration
it
is
so
long
a
chain
and
yet
every
link
rings
true
it
saved
me
from
ennui
he
answered
yawning
alas
i
already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
me
my
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
existence
these
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
and
you
are
a
benefactor
of
the
race
said
i
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
perhaps
after
all
it
is
of
some
little
use
he
remarked
rien
tout
as
gustave
flaubert
wrote
to
george
sand
adventure
iii
a
case
of
identity
my
dear
fellow
said
sherlock
holmes
as
we
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
his
lodgings
at
baker
street
life
is
infinitely
stranger
than
anything
which
the
mind
of
man
could
invent
we
would
not
dare
to
conceive
the
things
which
are
really
mere
commonplaces
of
existence
if
we
could
fly
out
of
that
window
hand
in
hand
hover
over
this
great
city
gently
remove
the
roofs
and
peep
in
at
the
queer
things
which
are
going
on
the
strange
coincidences
the
plannings
the
the
wonderful
chains
of
events
working
through
generations
and
leading
to
the
most
outré
results
it
would
make
all
fiction
with
its
conventionalities
and
foreseen
conclusions
most
stale
and
unprofitable
and
yet
i
am
not
convinced
of
it
i
answered
the
cases
which
come
to
light
in
the
papers
are
as
a
rule
bald
enough
and
vulgar
enough
we
have
in
our
police
reports
realism
pushed
to
its
extreme
limits
and
yet
the
result
is
it
must
be
confessed
neither
fascinating
nor
artistic
a
certain
selection
and
discretion
must
be
used
in
producing
a
realistic
effect
remarked
holmes
this
is
wanting
in
the
police
report
where
more
stress
is
laid
perhaps
upon
the
platitudes
of
the
magistrate
than
upon
the
details
which
to
an
observer
contain
the
vital
essence
of
the
whole
matter
depend
upon
it
there
is
nothing
so
unnatural
as
the
commonplace
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
i
can
quite
understand
your
thinking
so
i
said
of
course
in
your
position
of
unofficial
adviser
and
helper
to
everybody
who
is
absolutely
puzzled
throughout
three
continents
you
are
brought
in
contact
with
all
that
is
strange
and
bizarre
but
here
i
picked
up
the
morning
paper
from
the
ground
let
us
put
it
to
a
practical
test
here
is
the
first
heading
upon
which
i
come
husband
cruelty
to
his
wife
there
is
half
a
column
of
print
but
i
know
without
reading
it
that
it
is
all
perfectly
familiar
to
me
there
is
of
course
the
other
woman
the
drink
the
push
the
blow
the
bruise
the
sympathetic
sister
or
landlady
the
crudest
of
writers
could
invent
nothing
more
crude
indeed
your
example
is
an
unfortunate
one
for
your
argument
said
holmes
taking
the
paper
and
glancing
his
eye
down
it
this
is
the
dundas
separation
case
and
as
it
happens
i
was
engaged
in
clearing
up
some
small
points
in
connection
with
it
the
husband
was
a
teetotaler
there
was
no
other
woman
and
the
conduct
complained
of
was
that
he
had
drifted
into
the
habit
of
winding
up
every
meal
by
taking
out
his
false
teeth
and
hurling
them
at
his
wife
which
you
will
allow
is
not
an
action
likely
to
occur
to
the
imagination
of
the
average
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
doctor
and
acknowledge
that
i
have
scored
over
you
in
your
example
he
held
out
his
snuffbox
of
old
gold
with
a
great
amethyst
in
the
centre
of
the
lid
its
splendour
was
in
such
contrast
to
his
homely
ways
and
simple
life
that
i
could
not
help
commenting
upon
it
ah
said
he
i
forgot
that
i
had
not
seen
you
for
some
weeks
it
is
a
little
souvenir
from
the
king
of
bohemia
in
return
for
my
assistance
in
the
case
of
the
irene
adler
papers
and
the
ring
i
asked
glancing
at
a
remarkable
brilliant
which
sparkled
upon
his
finger
it
was
from
the
reigning
family
of
holland
though
the
matter
in
which
i
served
them
was
of
such
delicacy
that
i
can
not
confide
it
even
to
you
who
have
been
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
little
problems
and
have
you
any
on
hand
just
now
i
asked
with
interest
some
ten
or
twelve
but
none
which
present
any
feature
of
interest
they
are
important
you
understand
without
being
interesting
indeed
i
have
found
that
it
is
usually
in
unimportant
matters
that
there
is
a
field
for
the
observation
and
for
the
quick
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
which
gives
the
charm
to
an
investigation
the
larger
crimes
are
apt
to
be
the
simpler
for
the
bigger
the
crime
the
more
obvious
as
a
rule
is
the
motive
in
these
cases
save
for
one
rather
intricate
matter
which
has
been
referred
to
me
from
marseilles
there
is
nothing
which
presents
any
features
of
interest
it
is
possible
however
that
i
may
have
something
better
before
very
many
minutes
are
over
for
this
is
one
of
my
clients
or
i
am
much
mistaken
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
standing
between
the
parted
blinds
gazing
down
into
the
dull
london
street
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
saw
that
on
the
pavement
opposite
there
stood
a
large
woman
with
a
heavy
fur
boa
round
her
neck
and
a
large
curling
red
feather
in
a
hat
which
was
tilted
in
a
coquettish
duchess
of
devonshire
fashion
over
her
ear
from
under
this
great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in
a
nervous
hesitating
fashion
at
our
windows
while
her
body
oscillated
backward
and
forward
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove
buttons
suddenly
with
a
plunge
as
of
the
swimmer
who
leaves
the
bank
she
hurried
across
the
road
and
we
heard
the
sharp
clang
of
the
bell
i
have
seen
those
symptoms
before
said
holmes
throwing
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
oscillation
upon
the
pavement
always
means
an
affaire
de
coeur
she
would
like
advice
but
is
not
sure
that
the
matter
is
not
too
delicate
for
communication
and
yet
even
here
we
may
discriminate
when
a
woman
has
been
seriously
wronged
by
a
man
she
no
longer
oscillates
and
the
usual
symptom
is
a
broken
bell
wire
here
we
may
take
it
that
there
is
a
love
matter
but
that
the
maiden
is
not
so
much
angry
as
perplexed
or
grieved
but
here
she
comes
in
person
to
resolve
our
doubts
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
boy
in
buttons
entered
to
announce
miss
mary
sutherland
while
the
lady
herself
loomed
behind
his
small
black
figure
like
a
behind
a
tiny
pilot
boat
sherlock
holmes
welcomed
her
with
the
easy
courtesy
for
which
he
was
remarkable
and
having
closed
the
door
and
bowed
her
into
an
armchair
he
looked
her
over
in
the
minute
and
yet
abstracted
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
do
you
not
find
he
said
that
with
your
short
sight
it
is
a
little
trying
to
do
so
much
typewriting
i
did
at
first
she
answered
but
now
i
know
where
the
letters
are
without
looking
then
suddenly
realising
the
full
purport
of
his
words
she
gave
a
violent
start
and
looked
up
with
fear
and
astonishment
upon
her
broad
face
heard
about
me
holmes
she
cried
else
how
could
you
know
all
that
never
mind
said
holmes
laughing
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
perhaps
i
have
trained
myself
to
see
what
others
overlook
if
not
why
should
you
come
to
consult
me
i
came
to
you
sir
because
i
heard
of
you
from
etherege
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
dead
oh
holmes
i
wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
me
i
not
rich
but
still
i
have
a
hundred
a
year
in
my
own
right
besides
the
little
that
i
make
by
the
machine
and
i
would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
hosmer
angel
why
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such
a
hurry
asked
sherlock
holmes
with
his
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
again
a
startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
miss
mary
sutherland
yes
i
did
bang
out
of
the
house
she
said
for
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
windibank
that
is
my
father
took
it
all
he
would
not
go
to
the
police
and
he
would
not
go
to
you
and
so
at
last
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
done
it
made
me
mad
and
i
just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
you
your
father
said
holmes
your
stepfather
surely
since
the
name
is
different
yes
my
stepfather
i
call
him
father
though
it
sounds
funny
too
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
myself
and
your
mother
is
alive
oh
yes
mother
is
alive
and
well
i
was
best
pleased
holmes
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father
death
and
a
man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
herself
father
was
a
plumber
in
the
tottenham
court
road
and
he
left
a
tidy
business
behind
him
which
mother
carried
on
with
hardy
the
foreman
but
when
windibank
came
he
made
her
sell
the
business
for
he
was
very
superior
being
a
traveller
in
wines
they
got
pounds
for
the
goodwill
and
interest
which
near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
alive
i
had
expected
to
see
sherlock
holmes
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
narrative
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
attention
your
own
little
income
he
asked
does
it
come
out
of
the
business
oh
no
sir
it
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
ned
in
auckland
it
is
in
new
zealand
stock
paying
per
cent
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
amount
but
i
can
only
touch
the
interest
you
interest
me
extremely
said
holmes
and
since
you
draw
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
a
year
with
what
you
earn
into
the
bargain
you
no
doubt
travel
a
little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
way
i
believe
that
a
single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about
pounds
i
could
do
with
much
less
than
that
holmes
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as
i
live
at
home
i
do
wish
to
be
a
burden
to
them
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while
i
am
staying
with
them
of
course
that
is
only
just
for
the
time
windibank
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
mother
and
i
find
that
i
can
do
pretty
well
with
what
i
earn
at
typewriting
it
brings
me
twopence
a
sheet
and
i
can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in
a
day
you
have
made
your
position
very
clear
to
me
said
holmes
this
is
my
friend
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
kindly
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
hosmer
angel
a
flush
stole
over
miss
sutherland
face
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
jacket
i
met
him
first
at
the
gasfitters
ball
she
said
they
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
alive
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
us
and
sent
them
to
mother
windibank
did
not
wish
us
to
go
he
never
did
wish
us
to
go
anywhere
he
would
get
quite
mad
if
i
wanted
so
much
as
to
join
a
treat
but
this
time
i
was
set
on
going
and
i
would
go
for
what
right
had
he
to
prevent
he
said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
know
when
all
father
friends
were
to
be
there
and
he
said
that
i
had
nothing
fit
to
wear
when
i
had
my
purple
plush
that
i
had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
drawer
at
last
when
nothing
else
would
do
he
went
off
to
france
upon
the
business
of
the
firm
but
we
went
mother
and
i
with
hardy
who
used
to
be
our
foreman
and
it
was
there
i
met
hosmer
angel
i
suppose
said
holmes
that
when
windibank
came
back
from
france
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
ball
oh
well
he
was
very
good
about
it
he
laughed
i
remember
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to
a
woman
for
she
would
have
her
way
i
see
then
at
the
gasfitters
ball
you
met
as
i
understand
a
gentleman
called
hosmer
angel
yes
sir
i
met
him
that
night
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
safe
and
after
that
we
met
him
that
is
to
say
holmes
i
met
him
twice
for
walks
but
after
that
father
came
back
again
and
hosmer
angel
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
more
no
well
you
know
father
did
like
anything
of
the
sort
he
would
have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
used
to
say
that
a
woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
circle
but
then
as
i
used
to
say
to
mother
a
woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
with
and
i
had
not
got
mine
yet
but
how
about
hosmer
angel
did
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
you
well
father
was
going
off
to
france
again
in
a
week
and
hosmer
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
gone
we
could
write
in
the
meantime
and
he
used
to
write
every
day
i
took
the
letters
in
in
the
morning
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
know
were
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
time
oh
yes
holmes
we
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
took
hosmer
angel
was
a
cashier
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
and
what
office
that
the
worst
of
it
holmes
i
do
know
where
did
he
live
then
he
slept
on
the
premises
and
you
do
know
his
address
no
except
that
it
was
leadenhall
street
where
did
you
address
your
letters
then
to
the
leadenhall
street
post
office
to
be
left
till
called
for
he
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
chaffed
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from
a
lady
so
i
offered
to
typewrite
them
like
he
did
his
but
he
have
that
for
he
said
that
when
i
wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
me
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
us
that
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
me
holmes
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
of
it
was
most
suggestive
said
holmes
it
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
important
can
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
hosmer
angel
he
was
a
very
shy
man
holmes
he
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
daylight
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
conspicuous
very
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
was
even
his
voice
was
gentle
he
had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
young
he
told
me
and
it
had
left
him
with
a
weak
throat
and
a
hesitating
whispering
fashion
of
speech
he
was
always
well
dressed
very
neat
and
plain
but
his
eyes
were
weak
just
as
mine
are
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
glare
well
and
what
happened
when
windibank
your
stepfather
returned
to
france
hosmer
angel
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
back
he
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
swear
with
my
hands
on
the
testament
that
whatever
happened
i
would
always
be
true
to
him
mother
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
swear
and
that
it
was
a
sign
of
his
passion
mother
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than
i
was
then
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
week
i
began
to
ask
about
father
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
father
but
just
to
tell
him
afterwards
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
him
i
did
quite
like
that
holmes
it
seemed
funny
that
i
should
ask
his
leave
as
he
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
me
but
i
did
want
to
do
anything
on
the
sly
so
i
wrote
to
father
at
bordeaux
where
the
company
has
its
french
offices
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
it
missed
him
then
yes
sir
for
he
had
started
to
england
just
before
it
arrived
ha
that
was
unfortunate
your
wedding
was
arranged
then
for
the
friday
was
it
to
be
in
church
yes
sir
but
very
quietly
it
was
to
be
at
saviour
near
king
cross
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
pancras
hotel
hosmer
came
for
us
in
a
hansom
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into
a
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
street
we
got
to
the
church
first
and
when
the
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
out
but
he
never
did
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there
the
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
eyes
that
was
last
friday
holmes
and
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
him
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
treated
said
holmes
oh
no
sir
he
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
so
why
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
that
whatever
happened
i
was
to
be
true
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
us
i
was
always
to
remember
that
i
was
pledged
to
him
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
later
it
seemed
strange
talk
for
a
but
what
has
happened
since
gives
a
meaning
to
it
most
certainly
it
does
your
own
opinion
is
then
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
him
yes
sir
i
believe
that
he
foresaw
some
danger
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
so
and
then
i
think
that
what
he
foresaw
happened
but
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
been
none
one
more
question
how
did
your
mother
take
the
matter
she
was
angry
and
said
that
i
was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
again
and
your
father
did
you
tell
him
yes
and
he
seemed
to
think
with
me
that
something
had
happened
and
that
i
should
hear
of
hosmer
again
as
he
said
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
church
and
then
leaving
me
now
if
he
had
borrowed
my
money
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
him
there
might
be
some
reason
but
hosmer
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at
a
shilling
of
mine
and
yet
what
could
have
happened
and
why
could
he
not
write
oh
it
drives
me
to
think
of
it
and
i
ca
sleep
a
wink
at
night
she
pulled
a
little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
it
i
shall
glance
into
the
case
for
you
said
holmes
rising
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
result
let
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
now
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
further
above
all
try
to
let
hosmer
angel
vanish
from
your
memory
as
he
has
done
from
your
life
then
you
do
think
i
see
him
again
i
fear
not
then
what
has
happened
to
him
you
will
leave
that
question
in
my
hands
i
should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
spare
i
advertised
for
him
in
last
saturday
chronicle
said
she
here
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
him
thank
you
and
your
address
no
lyon
place
camberwell
angel
address
you
never
had
i
understand
where
is
your
father
place
of
business
he
travels
for
westhouse
marbank
the
great
claret
importers
of
fenchurch
street
thank
you
you
have
made
your
statement
very
clearly
you
will
leave
the
papers
here
and
remember
the
advice
which
i
have
given
you
let
the
whole
incident
be
a
sealed
book
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
life
you
are
very
kind
holmes
but
i
can
not
do
that
i
shall
be
true
to
hosmer
he
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
back
for
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
face
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
respect
she
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
way
with
a
promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
summoned
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
together
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
ceiling
then
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
pipe
which
was
to
him
as
a
counsellor
and
having
lit
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
thick
blue
spinning
up
from
him
and
a
look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
face
quite
an
interesting
study
that
maiden
he
observed
i
found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
problem
which
by
the
way
is
rather
a
trite
one
you
will
find
parallel
cases
if
you
consult
my
index
in
andover
in
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
the
hague
last
year
old
as
is
the
idea
however
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
me
but
the
maiden
herself
was
most
instructive
you
appeared
to
read
a
good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
me
i
remarked
not
invisible
but
unnoticed
watson
you
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
important
i
can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
sleeves
the
suggestiveness
of
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from
a
now
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman
appearance
describe
it
well
she
had
a
straw
hat
with
a
feather
of
a
brickish
red
her
jacket
was
black
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
it
and
a
fringe
of
little
black
jet
ornaments
her
dress
was
brown
rather
darker
than
coffee
colour
with
a
little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
her
gloves
were
greyish
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
forefinger
her
boots
i
observe
she
had
small
round
hanging
gold
earrings
and
a
general
air
of
being
fairly
in
a
vulgar
comfortable
way
sherlock
holmes
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
chuckled
my
word
watson
you
are
coming
along
wonderfully
you
have
really
done
very
well
indeed
it
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
method
and
you
have
a
quick
eye
for
colour
never
trust
to
general
impressions
my
boy
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
details
my
first
glance
is
always
at
a
woman
sleeve
in
a
man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
trouser
as
you
observe
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
sleeves
which
is
a
most
useful
material
for
showing
traces
the
double
line
a
little
above
the
wrist
where
the
typewritist
presses
against
the
table
was
beautifully
defined
the
of
the
hand
type
leaves
a
similar
mark
but
only
on
the
left
arm
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
thumb
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
part
as
this
was
i
then
glanced
at
her
face
and
observing
the
dint
of
a
at
either
side
of
her
nose
i
ventured
a
remark
upon
short
sight
and
typewriting
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
it
surprised
me
but
surely
it
was
obvious
i
was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
that
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
other
they
were
really
odd
ones
the
one
having
a
slightly
decorated
and
the
other
a
plain
one
one
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
five
and
the
other
at
the
first
third
and
fifth
now
when
you
see
that
a
young
lady
otherwise
neatly
dressed
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
boots
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in
a
hurry
and
what
else
i
asked
keenly
interested
as
i
always
was
by
my
friend
incisive
reasoning
i
noted
in
passing
that
she
had
written
a
note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
dressed
you
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
forefinger
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
ink
she
had
written
in
a
hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
deep
it
must
have
been
this
morning
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
finger
all
this
is
amusing
though
rather
elementary
but
i
must
go
back
to
business
watson
would
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
hosmer
angel
i
held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
light
missing
it
said
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
a
gentleman
named
hosmer
angel
about
five
seven
in
in
height
strongly
built
sallow
complexion
black
hair
a
little
bald
in
the
centre
bushy
black
and
moustache
tinted
glasses
slight
infirmity
of
speech
was
dressed
when
last
seen
in
black
faced
with
silk
black
waistcoat
gold
albert
chain
and
grey
harris
tweed
trousers
with
brown
gaiters
over
boots
known
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
anybody
bringing
that
will
do
said
holmes
as
to
the
letters
he
continued
glancing
over
them
they
are
very
commonplace
absolutely
no
clue
in
them
to
angel
save
that
he
quotes
balzac
once
there
is
one
remarkable
point
however
which
will
no
doubt
strike
you
they
are
typewritten
i
remarked
not
only
that
but
the
signature
is
typewritten
look
at
the
neat
little
angel
at
the
bottom
there
is
a
date
you
see
but
no
superscription
except
leadenhall
street
which
is
rather
vague
the
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive
in
fact
we
may
call
it
conclusive
of
what
my
dear
fellow
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
case
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
instituted
no
that
was
not
the
point
however
i
shall
write
two
letters
which
should
settle
the
matter
one
is
to
a
firm
in
the
city
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady
stepfather
windibank
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six
tomorrow
evening
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
relatives
and
now
doctor
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
come
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
interim
i
had
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend
subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that
i
felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
fathom
once
only
had
i
known
him
to
fail
in
the
case
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
of
the
irene
adler
photograph
but
when
i
looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
sign
of
four
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
study
in
scarlet
i
felt
that
it
would
be
a
strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
unravel
i
left
him
then
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
pipe
with
the
conviction
that
when
i
came
again
on
the
next
evening
i
would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
miss
mary
sutherland
a
professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
time
and
the
whole
of
next
day
i
was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
it
was
not
until
close
upon
six
that
i
found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into
a
hansom
and
drive
to
baker
street
half
afraid
that
i
might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
dénouement
of
the
little
mystery
i
found
sherlock
holmes
alone
however
half
asleep
with
his
long
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
armchair
a
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
acid
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him
well
have
you
solved
it
i
asked
as
i
entered
yes
it
was
the
bisulphate
of
baryta
no
no
the
mystery
i
cried
oh
that
i
thought
of
the
salt
that
i
have
been
working
upon
there
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
matter
though
as
i
said
yesterday
some
of
the
details
are
of
interest
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
law
i
fear
that
can
touch
the
scoundrel
who
was
he
then
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
miss
sutherland
the
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
and
holmes
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
reply
when
we
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
a
tap
at
the
door
this
is
the
girl
stepfather
james
windibank
said
holmes
he
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
six
come
in
the
man
who
entered
was
a
sturdy
fellow
some
thirty
years
of
age
and
with
a
bland
insinuating
manner
and
a
pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
eyes
he
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
each
of
us
placed
his
shiny
upon
the
sideboard
and
with
a
slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
chair
james
windibank
said
holmes
i
think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
you
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six
yes
sir
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
a
little
late
but
i
am
not
quite
my
own
master
you
know
i
am
sorry
that
miss
sutherland
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
matter
for
i
think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
public
it
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
came
but
she
is
a
very
excitable
impulsive
girl
as
you
may
have
noticed
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on
a
point
of
course
i
did
not
mind
you
so
much
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
police
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
a
family
misfortune
like
this
noised
abroad
besides
it
is
a
useless
expense
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
hosmer
angel
on
the
contrary
said
holmes
quietly
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
i
will
succeed
in
discovering
hosmer
angel
windibank
gave
a
violent
start
and
dropped
his
gloves
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
said
it
is
a
curious
thing
remarked
holmes
that
a
typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as
a
man
handwriting
unless
they
are
quite
new
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
alike
some
letters
get
more
worn
than
others
and
some
wear
only
on
one
side
now
you
remark
in
this
note
of
yours
windibank
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the
and
a
slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the
there
are
fourteen
other
characteristics
but
those
are
the
more
obvious
we
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
office
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
little
worn
our
visitor
answered
glancing
keenly
at
holmes
with
his
bright
little
eyes
and
now
i
will
show
you
what
is
really
a
very
interesting
study
windibank
holmes
continued
i
think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
crime
it
is
a
subject
to
which
i
have
devoted
some
little
attention
i
have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
man
they
are
all
typewritten
in
each
case
not
only
are
the
slurred
and
the
tailless
but
you
will
observe
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
lens
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which
i
have
alluded
are
there
as
well
windibank
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat
i
can
not
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
talk
holmes
he
said
if
you
can
catch
the
man
catch
him
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
it
certainly
said
holmes
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door
i
let
you
know
then
that
i
have
caught
him
what
where
shouted
windibank
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
oh
it
wo
do
really
it
wo
said
holmes
suavely
there
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it
windibank
it
is
quite
too
transparent
and
it
was
a
very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple
a
question
right
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
it
over
our
visitor
collapsed
into
a
chair
with
a
ghastly
face
and
a
glitter
of
moisture
on
his
brow
it
it
not
actionable
he
stammered
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
not
but
between
ourselves
windibank
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless
a
trick
in
a
petty
way
as
ever
came
before
me
now
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
events
and
you
will
contradict
me
if
i
go
wrong
the
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
like
one
who
is
utterly
crushed
holmes
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
talking
rather
to
himself
as
it
seemed
than
to
us
the
man
married
a
woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
money
said
he
and
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
them
it
was
a
considerable
sum
for
people
in
their
position
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made
a
serious
difference
it
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
it
the
daughter
was
of
a
good
amiable
disposition
but
affectionate
and
in
her
ways
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
advantages
and
her
little
income
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
long
now
her
marriage
would
mean
of
course
the
loss
of
a
hundred
a
year
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
it
he
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
age
but
soon
he
found
that
that
would
not
answer
forever
she
became
restive
insisted
upon
her
rights
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to
a
certain
ball
what
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
then
he
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
heart
with
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
himself
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
glasses
masked
the
face
with
a
moustache
and
a
pair
of
bushy
whiskers
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
whisper
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl
short
sight
he
appears
as
hosmer
angel
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
himself
it
was
only
a
joke
at
first
groaned
our
visitor
we
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
away
very
likely
not
however
that
may
be
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
away
and
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
france
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
mind
she
was
flattered
by
the
gentleman
attentions
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
mother
then
angel
began
to
call
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if
a
real
effect
were
to
be
produced
there
were
meetings
and
an
engagement
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl
affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
else
but
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
forever
these
pretended
journeys
to
france
were
rather
cumbrous
the
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such
a
dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave
a
permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady
mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
come
hence
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon
a
testament
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to
a
possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
james
windibank
wished
miss
sutherland
to
be
so
bound
to
hosmer
angel
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
fate
that
for
ten
years
to
come
at
any
rate
she
would
not
listen
to
another
man
as
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
her
and
then
as
he
could
go
no
farther
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of
a
and
out
at
the
other
i
think
that
was
the
chain
of
events
mr
windibank
our
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
holmes
had
been
talking
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with
a
cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
face
it
may
be
so
or
it
may
not
holmes
said
he
but
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
now
and
not
me
i
have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
first
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
constraint
the
law
can
not
as
you
say
touch
you
said
holmes
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
door
yet
there
never
was
a
man
who
deserved
punishment
more
if
the
young
lady
has
a
brother
or
a
friend
he
ought
to
lay
a
whip
across
your
shoulders
by
jove
he
continued
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man
face
it
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
client
but
here
a
hunting
crop
handy
and
i
think
i
shall
just
treat
myself
to
he
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
whip
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was
a
wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
stairs
the
heavy
hall
door
banged
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
james
windibank
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
road
there
a
scoundrel
said
holmes
laughing
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
more
that
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
bad
and
ends
on
a
gallows
the
case
has
in
some
respects
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
i
can
not
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
reasoning
i
remarked
well
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
hosmer
angel
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
conduct
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
incident
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
the
stepfather
then
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
together
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
away
was
suggestive
so
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
voice
which
both
hinted
at
a
disguise
as
did
the
bushy
whiskers
my
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
signature
which
of
course
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
it
you
see
all
these
isolated
facts
together
with
many
minor
ones
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
and
how
did
you
verify
them
having
once
spotted
my
man
it
was
easy
to
get
corroboration
i
knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
worked
having
taken
the
printed
description
i
eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of
a
disguise
the
whiskers
the
glasses
the
voice
and
i
sent
it
to
the
firm
with
a
request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
travellers
i
had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
typewriter
and
i
wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
here
as
i
expected
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
defects
the
same
post
brought
me
a
letter
from
westhouse
marbank
of
fenchurch
street
to
say
that
the
description
tallied
in
every
respect
with
that
of
their
employé
james
windibank
voilà
tout
and
miss
sutherland
if
i
tell
her
she
will
not
believe
me
you
may
remember
the
old
persian
saying
is
danger
for
him
who
taketh
the
tiger
cub
and
danger
also
for
whoso
snatches
a
delusion
from
a
woman
there
is
as
much
sense
in
hafiz
as
in
horace
and
as
much
knowledge
of
the
world
adventure
iv
the
boscombe
valley
mystery
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
one
morning
my
wife
and
i
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
telegram
it
was
from
sherlock
holmes
and
ran
in
this
way
have
you
a
couple
of
days
to
spare
have
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of
england
in
connection
with
boscombe
valley
tragedy
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
with
me
air
and
scenery
perfect
leave
paddington
by
the
what
do
you
say
dear
said
my
wife
looking
across
at
me
will
you
go
i
really
do
know
what
to
say
i
have
a
fairly
long
list
at
present
oh
anstruther
would
do
your
work
for
you
you
have
been
looking
a
little
pale
lately
i
think
that
the
change
would
do
you
good
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
sherlock
holmes
cases
i
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
were
not
seeing
what
i
gained
through
one
of
them
i
answered
but
if
i
am
to
go
i
must
pack
at
once
for
i
have
only
half
an
hour
my
experience
of
camp
life
in
afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
prompt
and
ready
traveller
my
wants
were
few
and
simple
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated
i
was
in
a
cab
with
my
valise
rattling
away
to
paddington
station
sherlock
holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform
his
tall
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
and
cloth
cap
it
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come
watson
said
he
it
makes
a
considerable
difference
to
me
having
someone
with
me
on
whom
i
can
thoroughly
rely
local
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
biassed
if
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats
i
shall
get
the
tickets
we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
holmes
had
brought
with
him
among
these
he
rummaged
and
read
with
intervals
of
and
of
meditation
until
we
were
past
reading
then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
a
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
case
he
asked
not
a
word
i
have
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
days
the
london
press
has
not
had
very
full
accounts
i
have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
particulars
it
seems
from
what
i
gather
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult
that
sounds
a
little
paradoxical
but
it
is
profoundly
true
singularity
is
almost
invariably
a
clue
the
more
featureless
and
commonplace
a
crime
is
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
home
in
this
case
however
they
have
established
a
very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
it
is
a
murder
then
well
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so
i
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until
i
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it
i
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
understand
it
in
a
very
few
words
boscombe
valley
is
a
country
district
not
very
far
from
ross
in
herefordshire
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
a
john
turner
who
made
his
money
in
australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country
one
of
the
farms
which
he
held
that
of
hatherley
was
let
to
charles
mccarthy
who
was
also
an
the
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible
turner
was
apparently
the
richer
man
so
mccarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained
it
seems
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality
as
they
were
frequently
together
mccarthy
had
one
son
a
lad
of
eighteen
and
turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living
they
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
english
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives
though
both
the
mccarthys
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
of
the
neighbourhood
mccarthy
kept
two
servants
a
man
and
a
girl
turner
had
a
considerable
household
some
at
the
least
that
is
as
much
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
families
now
for
the
facts
on
june
that
is
on
monday
last
mccarthy
left
his
house
at
hatherley
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
boscombe
pool
which
is
a
small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
boscombe
valley
he
had
been
out
with
his
in
the
morning
at
ross
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
three
from
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive
from
hatherley
to
the
boscombe
pool
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground
one
was
an
old
woman
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
and
the
other
was
william
crowder
a
in
the
employ
of
turner
both
these
witnesses
depose
that
mccarthy
was
walking
alone
the
adds
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
mccarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
son
james
mccarthy
going
the
same
way
with
a
gun
under
his
arm
to
the
best
of
his
belief
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time
and
the
son
was
following
him
he
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
the
two
mccarthys
were
seen
after
the
time
when
william
crowder
the
lost
sight
of
them
the
boscombe
pool
is
thickly
wooded
round
with
just
a
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge
a
girl
of
fourteen
patience
moran
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
of
the
boscombe
valley
estate
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers
she
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake
mccarthy
and
his
son
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
a
violent
quarrel
she
heard
mccarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father
she
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
mccarthys
quarrelling
near
boscombe
pool
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight
she
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
mccarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
he
was
much
excited
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood
on
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool
the
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon
the
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
of
his
gun
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
a
few
paces
of
the
body
under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested
and
a
verdict
of
murder
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
tuesday
he
was
on
wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
ross
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
assizes
those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
i
could
hardly
imagine
a
more
damning
case
i
remarked
if
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
a
criminal
it
does
so
here
circumstantial
evidence
is
a
very
tricky
thing
answered
holmes
thoughtfully
it
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
a
little
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit
there
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood
however
and
among
them
miss
turner
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner
who
believe
in
his
innocence
and
who
have
retained
lestrade
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
study
in
scarlet
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest
lestrade
being
rather
puzzled
has
referred
the
case
to
me
and
hence
it
is
that
two
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home
i
am
afraid
said
i
that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case
there
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact
he
answered
laughing
besides
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
lestrade
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
i
am
boasting
when
i
say
that
i
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing
or
even
of
understanding
to
take
the
first
example
to
hand
i
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
side
and
yet
i
question
whether
lestrade
would
have
noted
even
so
a
thing
as
that
how
on
earth
my
dear
fellow
i
know
you
well
i
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you
you
shave
every
morning
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other
i
could
not
imagine
a
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
a
result
i
only
quote
this
as
a
trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference
therein
lies
my
métier
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us
there
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest
and
which
are
worth
considering
what
are
they
it
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once
but
after
the
return
to
hatherley
farm
on
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
a
prisoner
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts
this
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner
jury
it
was
a
confession
i
ejaculated
no
for
it
was
followed
by
a
protestation
of
innocence
coming
on
the
top
of
such
a
damning
series
of
events
it
was
at
least
a
most
suspicious
remark
on
the
contrary
said
holmes
it
is
the
brightest
rift
which
i
can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds
however
innocent
he
might
be
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him
had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest
or
feigned
indignation
at
it
i
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
a
scheming
man
his
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man
or
else
as
a
man
of
considerable
and
firmness
as
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him
and
even
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him
the
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
a
healthy
mind
rather
than
of
a
guilty
one
i
shook
my
head
many
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
evidence
i
remarked
so
they
have
and
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
hanged
what
is
the
young
man
own
account
of
the
matter
it
is
i
am
afraid
not
very
encouraging
to
his
supporters
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
suggestive
you
will
find
it
here
and
may
read
it
for
yourself
he
picked
out
from
his
bundle
a
copy
of
the
local
herefordshire
paper
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred
i
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully
it
ran
in
this
way
james
mccarthy
the
only
son
of
the
deceased
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
bristol
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
monday
the
my
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
and
i
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
ross
with
john
cobb
the
groom
shortly
after
my
return
i
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard
and
looking
out
of
my
window
i
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard
though
i
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going
i
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
boscombe
pool
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side
on
my
way
i
saw
william
crowder
the
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
was
following
my
father
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me
when
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
i
heard
a
cry
of
cooee
which
was
a
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself
i
then
hurried
forward
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool
he
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
i
was
doing
there
a
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows
for
my
father
was
a
man
of
a
very
violent
temper
seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable
i
left
him
and
returned
towards
hatherley
farm
i
had
not
gone
more
than
yards
however
when
i
heard
a
hideous
outcry
behind
me
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again
i
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground
with
his
head
terribly
injured
i
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms
but
he
almost
instantly
expired
i
knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes
and
then
made
my
way
to
turner
his
house
being
the
nearest
to
ask
for
assistance
i
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
i
returned
and
i
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries
he
was
not
a
popular
man
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners
but
he
had
as
far
as
i
know
no
active
enemies
i
know
nothing
further
of
the
matter
the
coroner
did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died
witness
he
mumbled
a
few
words
but
i
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
a
rat
the
coroner
what
did
you
understand
by
that
witness
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me
i
thought
that
he
was
delirious
the
coroner
what
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel
witness
i
should
prefer
not
to
answer
the
coroner
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
press
it
witness
it
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
i
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed
the
coroner
that
is
for
the
court
to
decide
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise
witness
i
must
still
refuse
the
coroner
i
understand
that
the
cry
of
was
a
common
signal
between
you
and
your
father
witness
it
was
the
coroner
how
was
it
then
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
bristol
witness
with
considerable
confusion
i
do
not
know
a
juryman
did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured
witness
nothing
definite
the
coroner
what
do
you
mean
witness
i
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
i
rushed
out
into
the
open
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father
yet
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
as
i
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour
a
coat
of
some
sort
or
a
plaid
perhaps
when
i
rose
from
my
father
i
looked
round
for
it
but
it
was
gone
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help
it
was
gone
can
not
say
what
it
was
i
had
a
feeling
something
was
there
far
from
the
body
dozen
yards
or
so
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
same
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
a
dozen
yards
of
it
but
with
my
back
towards
it
this
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness
i
see
said
i
as
i
glanced
down
the
column
that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
mccarthy
he
calls
attention
and
with
reason
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father
dying
words
they
are
all
as
he
remarks
very
much
against
the
son
holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat
both
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains
said
he
to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man
favour
do
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little
too
little
if
he
could
not
invent
a
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury
too
much
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outré
as
a
dying
reference
to
a
rat
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth
no
sir
i
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us
and
now
here
is
my
pocket
petrarch
and
not
another
word
shall
i
say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
action
we
lunch
at
swindon
and
i
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
nearly
four
when
we
at
last
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
stroud
valley
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
severn
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
of
ross
a
lean
man
furtive
and
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
in
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
with
him
we
drove
to
the
hereford
arms
where
a
room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us
i
have
ordered
a
carriage
said
lestrade
as
we
sat
over
a
cup
of
tea
i
knew
your
energetic
nature
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
it
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you
holmes
answered
it
is
entirely
a
question
of
barometric
pressure
lestrade
looked
startled
i
do
not
quite
follow
he
said
how
is
the
glass
i
see
no
wind
and
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
i
have
a
caseful
of
cigarettes
here
which
need
smoking
and
the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
abomination
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
use
the
carriage
lestrade
laughed
indulgently
you
have
no
doubt
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers
he
said
the
case
is
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes
still
of
course
one
ca
refuse
a
lady
and
such
a
very
positive
one
too
she
has
heard
of
you
and
would
have
your
opinion
though
i
repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
i
had
not
already
done
why
bless
my
soul
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door
he
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
her
violet
eyes
shining
her
lips
parted
a
pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern
oh
sherlock
holmes
she
cried
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
finally
with
a
woman
quick
intuition
fastening
upon
my
companion
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
come
i
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so
i
know
that
james
did
do
it
i
know
it
and
i
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it
too
never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point
we
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children
and
i
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does
but
he
is
too
to
hurt
a
fly
such
a
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him
i
hope
we
may
clear
him
miss
turner
said
sherlock
holmes
you
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
i
can
but
you
have
read
the
evidence
you
have
formed
some
conclusion
do
you
not
see
some
loophole
some
flaw
do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent
i
think
that
it
is
very
probable
there
now
she
cried
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
lestrade
you
hear
he
gives
me
hopes
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
a
little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions
he
said
but
he
is
right
oh
i
know
that
he
is
right
james
never
did
it
and
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father
i
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
i
was
concerned
in
it
in
what
way
asked
holmes
it
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything
james
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me
mccarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
marriage
between
us
james
and
i
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet
and
and
well
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet
so
there
were
quarrels
and
this
i
am
sure
was
one
of
them
and
your
father
asked
holmes
was
he
in
favour
of
such
a
union
no
he
was
averse
to
it
also
no
one
but
mccarthy
was
in
favour
of
it
a
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
holmes
shot
one
of
his
keen
questioning
glances
at
her
thank
you
for
this
information
said
he
may
i
see
your
father
if
i
call
i
am
afraid
the
doctor
wo
allow
it
the
doctor
yes
have
you
not
heard
poor
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
back
but
this
has
broken
him
down
completely
he
has
taken
to
his
bed
and
willows
says
that
he
is
a
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
shattered
mccarthy
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
victoria
ha
in
victoria
that
is
important
yes
at
the
mines
quite
so
at
the
where
as
i
understand
turner
made
his
money
yes
certainly
thank
you
miss
turner
you
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
me
you
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
no
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
james
oh
if
you
do
holmes
do
tell
him
that
i
know
him
to
be
innocent
i
will
miss
turner
i
must
go
home
now
for
dad
is
very
ill
and
he
misses
me
so
if
i
leave
him
and
god
help
you
in
your
undertaking
she
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street
i
am
ashamed
of
you
holmes
said
lestrade
with
dignity
after
a
few
minutes
silence
why
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint
i
am
not
of
heart
but
i
call
it
cruel
i
think
that
i
see
my
way
to
clearing
james
mccarthy
said
holmes
have
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison
yes
but
only
for
you
and
me
then
i
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out
we
have
still
time
to
take
a
train
to
hereford
and
see
him
ample
then
let
us
do
so
watson
i
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow
but
i
shall
only
be
away
a
couple
of
hours
i
walked
down
to
the
station
with
them
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town
finally
returning
to
the
hotel
where
i
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
a
novel
the
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin
however
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping
and
i
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact
that
i
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
a
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day
supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man
story
were
absolutely
true
then
what
hellish
thing
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father
and
the
moment
when
drawn
back
by
his
screams
he
rushed
into
the
glade
it
was
something
terrible
and
deadly
what
could
it
be
might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts
i
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper
which
contained
a
verbatim
account
of
the
inquest
in
the
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
a
heavy
blow
from
a
blunt
weapon
i
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head
clearly
such
a
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind
that
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father
still
it
did
not
go
for
very
much
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell
still
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
holmes
attention
to
it
then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
a
rat
what
could
that
mean
it
could
not
be
delirium
a
man
dying
from
a
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious
no
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate
but
what
could
it
indicate
i
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation
and
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
mccarthy
if
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress
presumably
his
overcoat
in
his
flight
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
a
dozen
paces
off
what
a
tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was
i
did
not
wonder
at
lestrade
opinion
and
yet
i
had
so
much
faith
in
sherlock
holmes
insight
that
i
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
mccarthy
innocence
it
was
late
before
sherlock
holmes
returned
he
came
back
alone
for
lestrade
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
town
the
glass
still
keeps
very
high
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down
it
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
ground
on
the
other
hand
a
man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
that
and
i
did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
fagged
by
a
long
journey
i
have
seen
young
mccarthy
and
what
did
you
learn
from
him
nothing
could
he
throw
no
light
none
at
all
i
was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
her
but
i
am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
else
he
is
not
a
very
youth
though
comely
to
look
at
and
i
should
think
sound
at
heart
i
can
not
admire
his
taste
i
remarked
if
it
is
indeed
a
fact
that
he
was
averse
to
a
marriage
with
so
charming
a
young
lady
as
this
miss
turner
ah
thereby
hangs
a
rather
painful
tale
this
fellow
is
madly
insanely
in
love
with
her
but
some
two
years
ago
when
he
was
only
a
lad
and
before
he
really
knew
her
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at
a
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of
a
barmaid
in
bristol
and
marry
her
at
a
registry
office
no
one
knows
a
word
of
the
matter
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
upbraided
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
do
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
impossible
it
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
father
at
their
last
interview
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
miss
turner
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself
and
his
father
who
was
by
all
accounts
a
very
hard
man
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
truth
it
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
bristol
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
was
mark
that
point
it
is
of
importance
good
has
come
out
of
evil
however
for
the
barmaid
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
hanged
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has
a
husband
already
in
the
bermuda
dockyard
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
them
i
think
that
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
mccarthy
for
all
that
he
has
suffered
but
if
he
is
innocent
who
has
done
it
ah
who
i
would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
points
one
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
pool
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
son
for
his
son
was
away
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
return
the
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
returned
those
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
depends
and
now
let
us
talk
about
george
meredith
if
you
please
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
there
was
no
rain
as
holmes
had
foretold
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
cloudless
at
nine
lestrade
called
for
us
with
the
carriage
and
we
set
off
for
hatherley
farm
and
the
boscombe
pool
there
is
serious
news
this
morning
lestrade
observed
it
is
said
that
turner
of
the
hall
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
of
an
elderly
man
i
presume
said
holmes
about
sixty
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
abroad
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
time
this
business
has
had
a
very
bad
effect
upon
him
he
was
an
old
friend
of
mccarthy
and
i
may
add
a
great
benefactor
to
him
for
i
have
learned
that
he
gave
him
hatherley
farm
rent
free
indeed
that
is
interesting
said
holmes
oh
yes
in
a
hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
him
everybody
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
him
really
does
it
not
strike
you
as
a
little
singular
that
this
mccarthy
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
own
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
turner
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
turner
daughter
who
is
presumably
heiress
to
the
estate
and
that
in
such
a
very
cocksure
manner
as
if
it
were
merely
a
case
of
a
proposal
and
all
else
would
follow
it
is
the
more
strange
since
we
know
that
turner
himself
was
averse
to
the
idea
the
daughter
told
us
as
much
do
you
not
deduce
something
from
that
we
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
inferences
said
lestrade
winking
at
me
i
find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
facts
holmes
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
fancies
you
are
right
said
holmes
demurely
you
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
facts
anyhow
i
have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
of
replied
lestrade
with
some
warmth
and
that
is
that
mccarthy
senior
met
his
death
from
mccarthy
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine
well
moonshine
is
a
brighter
thing
than
fog
said
holmes
laughing
but
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
hatherley
farm
upon
the
left
yes
that
is
it
it
was
a
widespread
building
with
great
yellow
blotches
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
walls
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
chimneys
however
gave
it
a
stricken
look
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
it
we
called
at
the
door
when
the
maid
at
holmes
request
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
also
a
pair
of
the
son
though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
had
having
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
points
holmes
desired
to
be
led
to
the
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
boscombe
pool
sherlock
holmes
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such
a
scent
as
this
men
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
baker
street
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him
his
face
flushed
and
darkened
his
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
lines
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with
a
steely
glitter
his
face
was
bent
downward
his
shoulders
bowed
his
lips
compressed
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
long
sinewy
neck
his
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with
a
purely
animal
lust
for
the
chase
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that
a
question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
ears
or
at
the
most
only
provoked
a
quick
impatient
snarl
in
reply
swiftly
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
meadows
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
boscombe
pool
it
was
damp
marshy
ground
as
is
all
that
district
and
there
were
marks
of
many
feet
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
side
sometimes
holmes
would
hurry
on
sometimes
stop
dead
and
once
he
made
quite
a
little
detour
into
the
meadow
lestrade
and
i
walked
behind
him
the
detective
indifferent
and
contemptuous
while
i
watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards
a
definite
end
the
boscombe
pool
which
is
a
little
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
across
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
hatherley
farm
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
turner
above
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
red
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner
dwelling
on
the
hatherley
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
thick
and
there
was
a
narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
lake
lestrade
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
found
and
indeed
so
moist
was
the
ground
that
i
could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
man
to
holmes
as
i
could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
eyes
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
grass
he
ran
round
like
a
dog
who
is
picking
up
a
scent
and
then
turned
upon
my
companion
what
did
you
go
into
the
pool
for
he
asked
i
fished
about
with
a
rake
i
thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
trace
but
how
on
earth
oh
tut
tut
i
have
no
time
that
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
place
a
mole
could
trace
it
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
reeds
oh
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had
i
been
here
before
they
came
like
a
herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
it
here
is
where
the
party
with
the
came
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
body
but
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
feet
he
drew
out
a
lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have
a
better
view
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
us
these
are
young
mccarthy
feet
twice
he
was
walking
and
once
he
ran
swiftly
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
visible
that
bears
out
his
story
he
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
ground
then
here
are
the
father
feet
as
he
paced
up
and
down
what
is
this
then
it
is
the
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
listening
and
this
ha
ha
what
have
we
here
tiptoes
tiptoes
square
too
quite
unusual
boots
they
come
they
go
they
come
again
of
course
that
was
for
the
cloak
now
where
did
they
come
from
he
ran
up
and
down
sometimes
losing
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
beech
the
largest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
holmes
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
for
a
long
time
he
remained
there
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
sticks
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
reach
a
jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
moss
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
retained
then
he
followed
a
pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
highroad
where
all
traces
were
lost
it
has
been
a
case
of
considerable
interest
he
remarked
returning
to
his
natural
manner
i
fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
lodge
i
think
that
i
will
go
in
and
have
a
word
with
moran
and
perhaps
write
a
little
note
having
done
that
we
may
drive
back
to
our
luncheon
you
may
walk
to
the
cab
and
i
shall
be
with
you
presently
it
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
ross
holmes
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
wood
this
may
interest
you
lestrade
he
remarked
holding
it
out
the
murder
was
done
with
it
i
see
no
marks
there
are
none
how
do
you
know
then
the
grass
was
growing
under
it
it
had
only
lain
there
a
few
days
there
was
no
sign
of
a
place
whence
it
had
been
taken
it
corresponds
with
the
injuries
there
is
no
sign
of
any
other
weapon
and
the
murderer
is
a
tall
man
limps
with
the
right
leg
wears
and
a
grey
cloak
smokes
indian
cigars
uses
a
and
carries
a
blunt
in
his
pocket
there
are
several
other
indications
but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in
our
search
lestrade
laughed
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
still
a
sceptic
he
said
theories
are
all
very
well
but
we
have
to
deal
with
a
british
jury
nous
verrons
answered
holmes
calmly
you
work
your
own
method
and
i
shall
work
mine
i
shall
be
busy
this
afternoon
and
shall
probably
return
to
london
by
the
evening
train
and
leave
your
case
unfinished
no
finished
but
the
mystery
it
is
solved
who
was
the
criminal
then
the
gentleman
i
describe
but
who
is
he
surely
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
out
this
is
not
such
a
populous
neighbourhood
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
am
a
practical
man
he
said
and
i
really
can
not
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for
a
gentleman
with
a
game
leg
i
should
become
the
of
scotland
yard
all
right
said
holmes
quietly
i
have
given
you
the
chance
here
are
your
lodgings
i
shall
drop
you
a
line
before
i
leave
having
left
lestrade
at
his
rooms
we
drove
to
our
hotel
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
table
holmes
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with
a
pained
expression
upon
his
face
as
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
perplexing
position
look
here
watson
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
just
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for
a
little
i
know
quite
what
to
do
and
i
should
value
your
advice
light
a
cigar
and
let
me
expound
pray
do
so
well
now
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
mccarthy
narrative
which
struck
us
both
instantly
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
him
one
was
the
fact
that
his
father
should
according
to
his
account
cry
before
seeing
him
the
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to
a
rat
he
mumbled
several
words
you
understand
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son
ear
now
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
commence
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
true
what
of
this
then
well
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
son
the
son
as
far
as
he
knew
was
in
bristol
it
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
earshot
the
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
with
but
is
a
distinctly
australian
cry
and
one
which
is
used
between
australians
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
mccarthy
expected
to
meet
him
at
boscombe
pool
was
someone
who
had
been
in
australia
what
of
the
rat
then
sherlock
holmes
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
table
this
is
a
map
of
the
colony
of
victoria
he
said
i
wired
to
bristol
for
it
last
night
he
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
map
what
do
you
read
arat
i
read
and
now
he
raised
his
hand
ballarat
quite
so
that
was
the
word
the
man
uttered
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
syllables
he
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
murderer
so
and
so
of
ballarat
it
is
wonderful
i
exclaimed
it
is
obvious
and
now
you
see
i
had
narrowed
the
field
down
considerably
the
possession
of
a
grey
garment
was
a
third
point
which
granting
the
son
statement
to
be
correct
was
a
certainty
we
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
australian
from
ballarat
with
a
grey
cloak
certainly
and
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
district
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
estate
where
strangers
could
hardly
wander
quite
so
then
comes
our
expedition
of
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
i
gained
the
trifling
details
which
i
gave
to
that
imbecile
lestrade
as
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal
but
how
did
you
gain
them
you
know
my
method
it
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
trifles
his
height
i
know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
stride
his
boots
too
might
be
told
from
their
traces
yes
they
were
peculiar
boots
but
his
lameness
the
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
left
he
put
less
weight
upon
it
why
because
he
limped
he
was
lame
but
his
you
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
inquest
the
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
behind
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
side
now
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by
a
man
he
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
son
he
had
even
smoked
there
i
found
the
ash
of
a
cigar
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
indian
cigar
i
have
as
you
know
devoted
some
attention
to
this
and
written
a
little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
different
varieties
of
pipe
cigar
and
cigarette
tobacco
having
found
the
ash
i
then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it
it
was
an
indian
cigar
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
rotterdam
and
the
i
could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
mouth
therefore
he
used
a
holder
the
tip
had
been
cut
off
not
bitten
off
but
the
cut
was
not
a
clean
one
so
i
deduced
a
blunt
holmes
i
said
you
have
drawn
a
net
round
this
man
from
which
he
can
not
escape
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
him
i
see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
points
the
culprit
is
john
turner
cried
the
hotel
waiter
opening
the
door
of
our
and
ushering
in
a
visitor
the
man
who
entered
was
a
strange
and
impressive
figure
his
slow
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
decrepitude
and
yet
his
hard
craggy
features
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
character
his
tangled
beard
grizzled
hair
and
outstanding
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
appearance
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
white
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with
a
shade
of
blue
it
was
clear
to
me
at
a
glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
disease
pray
sit
down
on
the
sofa
said
holmes
gently
you
had
my
note
yes
the
brought
it
up
you
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
scandal
i
thought
people
would
talk
if
i
went
to
the
hall
and
why
did
you
wish
to
see
me
he
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
eyes
as
though
his
question
was
already
answered
yes
said
holmes
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
words
it
is
so
i
know
all
about
mccarthy
the
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
god
help
me
he
cried
but
i
would
not
have
let
the
young
man
come
to
harm
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
would
have
spoken
out
if
it
went
against
him
at
the
assizes
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
holmes
gravely
i
would
have
spoken
now
had
it
not
been
for
my
dear
girl
it
would
break
her
heart
it
will
break
her
heart
when
she
hears
that
i
am
arrested
it
may
not
come
to
that
said
holmes
what
i
am
no
official
agent
i
understand
that
it
was
your
daughter
who
required
my
presence
here
and
i
am
acting
in
her
interests
young
mccarthy
must
be
got
off
however
i
am
a
dying
man
said
old
turner
i
have
had
diabetes
for
years
my
doctor
says
it
is
a
question
whether
i
shall
live
a
month
yet
i
would
rather
die
under
my
own
roof
than
in
a
gaol
holmes
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
a
bundle
of
paper
before
him
just
tell
us
the
truth
he
said
i
shall
jot
down
the
facts
you
will
sign
it
and
watson
here
can
witness
it
then
i
could
produce
your
confession
at
the
last
extremity
to
save
young
mccarthy
i
promise
you
that
i
shall
not
use
it
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed
it
as
well
said
the
old
man
it
a
question
whether
i
shall
live
to
the
assizes
so
it
matters
little
to
me
but
i
should
wish
to
spare
alice
the
shock
and
now
i
will
make
the
thing
clear
to
you
it
has
been
a
long
time
in
the
acting
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
tell
you
did
know
this
dead
man
mccarthy
he
was
a
devil
incarnate
i
tell
you
that
god
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
a
man
as
he
his
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
years
and
he
has
blasted
my
life
i
tell
you
first
how
i
came
to
be
in
his
power
it
was
in
the
early
at
the
diggings
i
was
a
young
chap
then
and
reckless
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
anything
i
got
among
bad
companions
took
to
drink
had
no
luck
with
my
claim
took
to
the
bush
and
in
a
word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here
a
highway
robber
there
were
six
of
us
and
we
had
a
wild
free
life
of
it
sticking
up
a
station
from
time
to
time
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
diggings
black
jack
of
ballarat
was
the
name
i
went
under
and
our
party
is
still
remembered
in
the
colony
as
the
ballarat
gang
one
day
a
gold
convoy
came
down
from
ballarat
to
melbourne
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
it
there
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
us
so
it
was
a
close
thing
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
volley
three
of
our
boys
were
killed
however
before
we
got
the
swag
i
put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
who
was
this
very
man
mccarthy
i
wish
to
the
lord
that
i
had
shot
him
then
but
i
spared
him
though
i
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
as
though
to
remember
every
feature
we
got
away
with
the
gold
became
wealthy
men
and
made
our
way
over
to
england
without
being
suspected
there
i
parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to
a
quiet
and
respectable
life
i
bought
this
estate
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
market
and
i
set
myself
to
do
a
little
good
with
my
money
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which
i
had
earned
it
i
married
too
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
alice
even
when
she
was
just
a
baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
in
a
word
i
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
past
all
was
going
well
when
mccarthy
laid
his
grip
upon
me
i
had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
investment
and
i
met
him
in
regent
street
with
hardly
a
coat
to
his
back
or
a
boot
to
his
foot
we
are
jack
says
he
touching
me
on
the
arm
be
as
good
as
a
family
to
you
there
two
of
us
me
and
my
son
and
you
can
have
the
keeping
of
us
if
you
do
it
a
fine
country
is
england
and
there
always
a
policeman
within
hail
well
down
they
came
to
the
west
country
there
was
no
shaking
them
off
and
there
they
have
lived
rent
free
on
my
best
land
ever
since
there
was
no
rest
for
me
no
peace
no
forgetfulness
turn
where
i
would
there
was
his
cunning
grinning
face
at
my
elbow
it
grew
worse
as
alice
grew
up
for
he
soon
saw
i
was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
police
whatever
he
wanted
he
must
have
and
whatever
it
was
i
gave
him
without
question
land
money
houses
until
at
last
he
asked
a
thing
which
i
could
not
give
he
asked
for
alice
his
son
you
see
had
grown
up
and
so
had
my
girl
and
as
i
was
known
to
be
in
weak
health
it
seemed
a
fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
property
but
there
i
was
firm
i
would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
mine
not
that
i
had
any
dislike
to
the
lad
but
his
blood
was
in
him
and
that
was
enough
i
stood
firm
mccarthy
threatened
i
braved
him
to
do
his
worst
we
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
over
when
i
went
down
there
i
found
him
talking
with
his
son
so
i
smoked
a
cigar
and
waited
behind
a
tree
until
he
should
be
alone
but
as
i
listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
uppermost
he
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were
a
slut
from
off
the
streets
it
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
i
and
all
that
i
held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
man
as
this
could
i
not
snap
the
bond
i
was
already
a
dying
and
a
desperate
man
though
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
limb
i
knew
that
my
own
fate
was
sealed
but
my
memory
and
my
girl
both
could
be
saved
if
i
could
but
silence
that
foul
tongue
i
did
it
holmes
i
would
do
it
again
deeply
as
i
have
sinned
i
have
led
a
life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
it
but
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than
i
could
suffer
i
struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
beast
his
cry
brought
back
his
son
but
i
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
wood
though
i
was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which
i
had
dropped
in
my
flight
that
is
the
true
story
gentlemen
of
all
that
occurred
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
said
holmes
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn
out
i
pray
that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such
a
temptation
i
pray
not
sir
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
in
view
of
your
health
nothing
you
are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at
a
higher
court
than
the
assizes
i
will
keep
your
confession
and
if
mccarthy
is
condemned
i
shall
be
forced
to
use
it
if
not
it
shall
never
be
seen
by
mortal
eye
and
your
secret
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead
shall
be
safe
with
us
farewell
then
said
the
old
man
solemnly
your
own
deathbeds
when
they
come
will
be
the
easier
for
the
thought
of
the
peace
which
you
have
given
to
mine
tottering
and
shaking
in
all
his
giant
frame
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
room
god
help
us
said
holmes
after
a
long
silence
why
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
poor
helpless
worms
i
never
hear
of
such
a
case
as
this
that
i
do
not
think
of
baxter
words
and
say
but
for
the
grace
of
god
goes
sherlock
holmes
james
mccarthy
was
acquitted
at
the
assizes
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
holmes
and
submitted
to
the
defending
counsel
old
turner
lived
for
seven
months
after
our
interview
but
he
is
now
dead
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
past
adventure
the
five
orange
pips
when
i
glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
sherlock
holmes
cases
between
the
years
and
i
am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
leave
some
however
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
papers
and
others
have
not
offered
a
field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high
a
degree
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
illustrate
some
too
have
baffled
his
analytical
skill
and
would
be
as
narratives
beginnings
without
an
ending
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
up
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
him
there
is
however
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that
i
am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
been
and
probably
never
will
be
entirely
cleared
up
the
year
furnished
us
with
a
long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
interest
of
which
i
retain
the
records
among
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months
i
find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
paradol
chamber
of
the
amateur
mendicant
society
who
held
a
luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of
a
furniture
warehouse
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
british
barque
sophy
anderson
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
grice
patersons
in
the
island
of
uffa
and
finally
of
the
camberwell
poisoning
case
in
the
latter
as
may
be
remembered
sherlock
holmes
was
able
by
winding
up
the
dead
man
watch
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
before
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
time
a
deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
case
all
these
i
may
sketch
out
at
some
future
date
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which
i
have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
describe
it
was
in
the
latter
days
of
september
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
violence
all
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
windows
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
great
london
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
civilisation
like
untamed
beasts
in
a
cage
as
evening
drew
in
the
storm
grew
higher
and
louder
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like
a
child
in
the
chimney
sherlock
holmes
sat
moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
his
records
of
crime
while
i
at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
clark
russell
fine
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
text
and
the
splash
of
the
rain
to
lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
waves
my
wife
was
on
a
visit
to
her
mother
and
for
a
few
days
i
was
a
dweller
once
more
in
my
old
quarters
at
baker
street
why
said
i
glancing
up
at
my
companion
that
was
surely
the
bell
who
could
come
some
friend
of
yours
perhaps
except
yourself
i
have
none
he
answered
i
do
not
encourage
visitors
a
client
then
if
so
it
is
a
serious
case
nothing
less
would
bring
a
man
out
on
such
a
day
and
at
such
an
hour
but
i
take
it
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
some
crony
of
the
landlady
sherlock
holmes
was
wrong
in
his
conjecture
however
for
there
came
a
step
in
the
passage
and
a
tapping
at
the
door
he
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself
and
towards
the
vacant
chair
upon
which
a
newcomer
must
sit
come
in
said
he
the
man
who
entered
was
young
some
at
the
outside
and
trimly
clad
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy
in
his
bearing
the
streaming
umbrella
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had
come
he
looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp
and
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
heavy
like
those
of
a
man
who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
anxiety
i
owe
you
an
apology
he
said
raising
his
golden
to
his
eyes
i
trust
that
i
am
not
intruding
i
fear
that
i
have
brought
some
traces
of
the
storm
and
rain
into
your
snug
chamber
give
me
your
coat
and
umbrella
said
holmes
they
may
rest
here
on
the
hook
and
will
be
dry
presently
you
have
come
up
from
the
i
see
yes
from
horsham
that
clay
and
chalk
mixture
which
i
see
upon
your
toe
caps
is
quite
distinctive
i
have
come
for
advice
that
is
easily
got
and
help
that
is
not
always
so
easy
i
have
heard
of
you
holmes
i
heard
from
major
prendergast
how
you
saved
him
in
the
tankerville
club
scandal
ah
of
course
he
was
wrongfully
accused
of
cheating
at
cards
he
said
that
you
could
solve
anything
he
said
too
much
that
you
are
never
beaten
i
have
been
beaten
four
times
three
times
by
men
and
once
by
a
woman
but
what
is
that
compared
with
the
number
of
your
successes
it
is
true
that
i
have
been
generally
successful
then
you
may
be
so
with
me
i
beg
that
you
will
draw
your
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
favour
me
with
some
details
as
to
your
case
it
is
no
ordinary
one
none
of
those
which
come
to
me
are
i
am
the
last
court
of
appeal
and
yet
i
question
sir
whether
in
all
your
experience
you
have
ever
listened
to
a
more
mysterious
and
inexplicable
chain
of
events
than
those
which
have
happened
in
my
own
family
you
fill
me
with
interest
said
holmes
pray
give
us
the
essential
facts
from
the
commencement
and
i
can
afterwards
question
you
as
to
those
details
which
seem
to
me
to
be
most
important
the
young
man
pulled
his
chair
up
and
pushed
his
wet
feet
out
towards
the
blaze
my
name
said
he
is
john
openshaw
but
my
own
affairs
have
as
far
as
i
can
understand
little
to
do
with
this
awful
business
it
is
a
hereditary
matter
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
facts
i
must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
affair
you
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
sons
my
uncle
elias
and
my
father
joseph
my
father
had
a
small
factory
at
coventry
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
bicycling
he
was
a
patentee
of
the
openshaw
unbreakable
tire
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon
a
handsome
competence
my
uncle
elias
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
became
a
planter
in
florida
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
well
at
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
jackson
army
and
afterwards
under
hood
where
he
rose
to
be
a
colonel
when
lee
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
plantation
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
years
about
or
he
came
back
to
europe
and
took
a
small
estate
in
sussex
near
horsham
he
had
made
a
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
states
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
negroes
and
his
dislike
of
the
republican
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
them
he
was
a
singular
man
fierce
and
very
when
he
was
angry
and
of
a
most
retiring
disposition
during
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
horsham
i
doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
town
he
had
a
garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
house
and
there
he
would
take
his
exercise
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
room
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
heavily
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
friends
not
even
his
own
brother
he
did
mind
me
in
fact
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first
i
was
a
youngster
of
twelve
or
so
this
would
be
in
the
year
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
england
he
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
way
when
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
me
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
tradespeople
so
that
by
the
time
that
i
was
sixteen
i
was
quite
master
of
the
house
i
kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where
i
liked
and
do
what
i
liked
so
long
as
i
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
privacy
there
was
one
singular
exception
however
for
he
had
a
single
room
a
up
among
the
attics
which
was
invariably
locked
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
enter
with
a
boy
curiosity
i
have
peeped
through
the
keyhole
but
i
was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such
a
collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such
a
room
one
day
it
was
in
march
a
letter
with
a
foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel
plate
it
was
not
a
common
thing
for
him
to
receive
letters
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
money
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
sort
india
said
he
as
he
took
it
up
postmark
what
can
this
be
opening
it
hurriedly
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
pips
which
pattered
down
upon
his
plate
i
began
to
laugh
at
this
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
face
his
lip
had
fallen
his
eyes
were
protruding
his
skin
the
colour
of
putty
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
hand
k
he
shrieked
and
then
god
my
god
my
sins
have
overtaken
me
is
it
uncle
i
cried
said
he
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
room
leaving
me
palpitating
with
horror
i
took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
flap
just
above
the
gum
the
letter
k
three
times
repeated
there
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
pips
what
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
terror
i
left
the
and
as
i
ascended
the
stair
i
met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
key
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
attic
in
one
hand
and
a
small
brass
box
like
a
cashbox
in
the
other
may
do
what
they
like
but
i
checkmate
them
still
said
he
with
an
oath
mary
that
i
shall
want
a
fire
in
my
room
and
send
down
to
fordham
the
horsham
lawyer
i
did
as
he
ordered
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived
i
was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
room
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
in
the
grate
there
was
a
mass
of
black
fluffy
ashes
as
of
burned
paper
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
it
as
i
glanced
at
the
box
i
noticed
with
a
start
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble
k
which
i
had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
envelope
wish
you
john
said
my
uncle
witness
my
will
i
leave
my
estate
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
disadvantages
to
my
brother
your
father
whence
it
will
no
doubt
descend
to
you
if
you
can
enjoy
it
in
peace
well
and
good
if
you
find
you
can
not
take
my
advice
my
boy
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
enemy
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
such
a
thing
but
i
say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
take
kindly
sign
the
paper
where
fordham
shows
you
i
signed
the
paper
as
directed
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
him
the
singular
incident
made
as
you
may
think
the
deepest
impression
upon
me
and
i
pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
it
yet
i
could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
behind
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
lives
i
could
see
a
change
in
my
uncle
however
he
drank
more
than
ever
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
society
most
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
room
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
inside
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in
a
sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
up
like
a
sheep
in
a
pen
by
man
or
devil
when
these
hot
fits
were
over
however
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
him
like
a
man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
soul
at
such
times
i
have
seen
his
face
even
on
a
cold
day
glisten
with
moisture
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from
a
basin
well
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
matter
holmes
and
not
to
abuse
your
patience
there
came
a
night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
back
we
found
him
when
we
went
to
search
for
him
face
downward
in
a
little
pool
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
there
was
no
sign
of
any
violence
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
deep
so
that
the
jury
having
regard
to
his
known
eccentricity
brought
in
a
verdict
of
but
i
who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
death
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
it
the
matter
passed
however
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate
and
of
some
pounds
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
bank
one
moment
holmes
interposed
your
statement
is
i
foresee
one
of
the
most
remarkable
to
which
i
have
ever
listened
let
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your
uncle
of
the
letter
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
suicide
the
letter
arrived
on
march
his
death
was
seven
weeks
later
upon
the
night
of
may
thank
you
pray
proceed
when
my
father
took
over
the
horsham
property
he
at
my
request
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
attic
which
had
been
always
locked
up
we
found
the
brass
box
there
although
its
contents
had
been
destroyed
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
a
paper
label
with
the
initials
of
repeated
upon
it
and
memoranda
receipts
and
a
register
written
beneath
these
we
presume
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
colonel
openshaw
for
the
rest
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save
a
great
many
scattered
papers
and
bearing
upon
my
uncle
life
in
america
some
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of
a
brave
soldier
others
were
of
a
date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
southern
states
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
politics
for
he
had
evidently
taken
a
strong
part
in
opposing
the
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
north
well
it
was
the
beginning
of
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
horsham
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
january
of
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year
i
heard
my
father
give
a
sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
there
he
was
sitting
with
a
newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
pips
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
one
he
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
story
about
the
colonel
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
himself
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
john
he
stammered
my
heart
had
turned
to
lead
is
said
i
he
looked
inside
the
envelope
it
is
he
cried
are
the
very
letters
but
what
is
this
written
above
them
the
papers
on
the
sundial
i
read
peeping
over
his
shoulder
papers
what
sundial
he
asked
sundial
in
the
garden
there
is
no
other
said
i
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
destroyed
said
he
gripping
hard
at
his
courage
are
in
a
civilised
land
here
and
we
ca
have
tomfoolery
of
this
kind
where
does
the
thing
come
from
dundee
i
answered
glancing
at
the
postmark
preposterous
practical
joke
said
he
have
i
to
do
with
sundials
and
papers
i
shall
take
no
notice
of
such
nonsense
should
certainly
speak
to
the
police
i
said
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains
nothing
of
the
sort
let
me
do
so
i
forbid
you
i
wo
have
a
fuss
made
about
such
nonsense
it
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
him
for
he
was
a
very
obstinate
man
i
went
about
however
with
a
heart
which
was
full
of
forebodings
on
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
his
major
freebody
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
portsdown
hill
i
was
glad
that
he
should
go
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
home
in
that
however
i
was
in
error
upon
the
second
day
of
his
absence
i
received
a
telegram
from
the
major
imploring
me
to
come
at
once
my
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
which
abound
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
lying
senseless
with
a
shattered
skull
i
hurried
to
him
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
consciousness
he
had
as
it
appears
been
returning
from
fareham
in
the
twilight
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
unfenced
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
from
accidental
causes
carefully
as
i
examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
death
i
was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
murder
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
no
footmarks
no
robbery
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
roads
and
yet
i
need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
ease
and
that
i
was
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
him
in
this
sinister
way
i
came
into
my
inheritance
you
will
ask
me
why
i
did
not
dispose
of
it
i
answer
because
i
was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle
life
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
another
it
was
in
january
that
my
poor
father
met
his
end
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
then
during
that
time
i
have
lived
happily
at
horsham
and
i
had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
family
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
generation
i
had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
soon
however
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
father
the
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat
a
crumpled
envelope
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
pips
this
is
the
envelope
he
continued
the
postmark
is
london
eastern
division
within
are
the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father
last
message
and
then
the
papers
on
the
sundial
what
have
you
done
asked
holmes
nothing
nothing
to
tell
the
truth
he
sank
his
face
into
his
thin
white
hands
i
have
felt
helpless
i
have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
it
i
seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
resistless
inexorable
evil
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
against
tut
tut
cried
sherlock
holmes
you
must
act
man
or
you
are
lost
nothing
but
energy
can
save
you
this
is
no
time
for
despair
i
have
seen
the
police
ah
but
they
listened
to
my
story
with
a
smile
i
am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
jokes
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
accidents
as
the
jury
stated
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
warnings
holmes
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air
incredible
imbecility
he
cried
they
have
however
allowed
me
a
policeman
who
may
remain
in
the
house
with
me
has
he
come
with
you
no
his
orders
were
to
stay
in
the
house
again
holmes
raved
in
the
air
why
did
you
come
to
me
he
cried
and
above
all
why
did
you
not
come
at
once
i
did
not
know
it
was
only
that
i
spoke
to
major
prendergast
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
you
it
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
letter
we
should
have
acted
before
this
you
have
no
further
evidence
i
suppose
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
us
no
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
us
there
is
one
thing
said
john
openshaw
he
rummaged
in
his
coat
pocket
and
drawing
out
a
piece
of
discoloured
paper
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
table
i
have
some
remembrance
said
he
that
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers
i
observed
that
the
small
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
colour
i
found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
room
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
has
perhaps
fluttered
out
from
among
the
others
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
destruction
beyond
the
mention
of
pips
i
do
not
see
that
it
helps
us
much
i
think
myself
that
it
is
a
page
from
some
private
diary
the
writing
is
undoubtedly
my
uncle
holmes
moved
the
lamp
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from
a
book
it
was
headed
march
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
notices
hudson
came
same
old
platform
set
the
pips
on
mccauley
paramore
and
john
swain
of
augustine
mccauley
cleared
john
swain
cleared
visited
paramore
all
well
thank
you
said
holmes
folding
up
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
our
visitor
and
now
you
must
on
no
account
lose
another
instant
we
can
not
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
me
you
must
get
home
instantly
and
act
what
shall
i
do
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
it
must
be
done
at
once
you
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
described
you
must
also
put
in
a
note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
uncle
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
remains
you
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
them
having
done
this
you
must
at
once
put
the
box
out
upon
the
sundial
as
directed
do
you
understand
entirely
do
not
think
of
revenge
or
anything
of
the
sort
at
present
i
think
that
we
may
gain
that
by
means
of
the
law
but
we
have
our
web
to
weave
while
theirs
is
already
woven
the
first
consideration
is
to
remove
the
pressing
danger
which
threatens
you
the
second
is
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
to
punish
the
guilty
parties
i
thank
you
said
the
young
man
rising
and
pulling
on
his
overcoat
you
have
given
me
fresh
life
and
hope
i
shall
certainly
do
as
you
advise
do
not
lose
an
instant
and
above
all
take
care
of
yourself
in
the
meanwhile
for
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
doubt
that
you
are
threatened
by
a
very
real
and
imminent
danger
how
do
you
go
back
by
train
from
waterloo
it
is
not
yet
nine
the
streets
will
be
crowded
so
i
trust
that
you
may
be
in
safety
and
yet
you
can
not
guard
yourself
too
closely
i
am
armed
that
is
well
i
shall
set
to
work
upon
your
case
i
shall
see
you
at
horsham
then
no
your
secret
lies
in
london
it
is
there
that
i
shall
seek
it
then
i
shall
call
upon
you
in
a
day
or
in
two
days
with
news
as
to
the
box
and
the
papers
i
shall
take
your
advice
in
every
particular
he
shook
hands
with
us
and
took
his
leave
outside
the
wind
still
screamed
and
the
rain
splashed
and
pattered
against
the
windows
this
strange
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
elements
blown
in
upon
us
like
a
sheet
of
in
a
gale
and
now
to
have
been
reabsorbed
by
them
once
more
sherlock
holmes
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
then
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
ceiling
i
think
watson
he
remarked
at
last
that
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
this
save
perhaps
the
sign
of
four
well
yes
save
perhaps
that
and
yet
this
john
openshaw
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
sholtos
but
have
you
i
asked
formed
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
are
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
nature
he
answered
then
what
are
they
who
is
this
and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
family
sherlock
holmes
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
together
the
ideal
reasoner
he
remarked
would
when
he
had
once
been
shown
a
single
fact
in
all
its
bearings
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
it
as
cuvier
could
correctly
describe
a
whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of
a
single
bone
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in
a
series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
ones
both
before
and
after
we
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
to
problems
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought
a
solution
by
the
aid
of
their
senses
to
carry
the
art
however
to
its
highest
pitch
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge
and
this
in
itself
implies
as
you
will
readily
see
a
possession
of
all
knowledge
which
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopaedias
is
a
somewhat
rare
accomplishment
it
is
not
so
impossible
however
that
a
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work
and
this
i
have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
do
if
i
remember
rightly
you
on
one
occasion
in
the
early
days
of
our
friendship
defined
my
limits
in
a
very
precise
fashion
yes
i
answered
laughing
it
was
a
singular
document
philosophy
astronomy
and
politics
were
marked
at
zero
i
remember
botany
variable
geology
profound
as
regards
the
from
any
region
within
fifty
miles
of
town
chemistry
eccentric
anatomy
unsystematic
sensational
literature
and
crime
records
unique
boxer
swordsman
lawyer
and
by
cocaine
and
tobacco
those
i
think
were
the
main
points
of
my
analysis
holmes
grinned
at
the
last
item
well
he
said
i
say
now
as
i
said
then
that
a
man
should
keep
his
little
stocked
with
all
the
furniture
that
he
is
likely
to
use
and
the
rest
he
can
put
away
in
the
of
his
library
where
he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
it
now
for
such
a
case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
resources
kindly
hand
me
down
the
letter
k
of
the
encyclopaedia
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
you
thank
you
now
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
it
in
the
first
place
we
may
start
with
a
strong
presumption
that
colonel
openshaw
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
america
men
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
florida
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
english
provincial
town
his
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
england
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
something
so
we
may
assume
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
america
as
to
what
it
was
he
feared
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
successors
did
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
letters
the
first
was
from
pondicherry
the
second
from
dundee
and
the
third
from
london
from
east
london
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
they
are
all
seaports
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship
excellent
we
have
already
a
clue
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
probability
the
strong
probability
is
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
ship
and
now
let
us
consider
another
point
in
the
case
of
pondicherry
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
fulfilment
in
dundee
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
days
does
that
suggest
anything
a
greater
distance
to
travel
but
the
letter
had
also
a
greater
distance
to
come
then
i
do
not
see
the
point
there
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is
a
it
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
mission
you
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
dundee
if
they
had
come
from
pondicherry
in
a
steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
letter
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
seven
weeks
elapsed
i
think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
writer
it
is
possible
more
than
that
it
is
probable
and
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
case
and
why
i
urged
young
openshaw
to
caution
the
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
distance
but
this
one
comes
from
london
and
therefore
we
can
not
count
upon
delay
good
god
i
cried
what
can
it
mean
this
relentless
persecution
the
papers
which
openshaw
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
them
a
single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
a
coroner
jury
there
must
have
been
several
in
it
and
they
must
have
been
men
of
resource
and
determination
their
papers
they
mean
to
have
be
the
holder
of
them
who
it
may
in
this
way
you
see
ceases
to
be
the
initials
of
an
individual
and
becomes
the
badge
of
a
society
but
of
what
society
have
you
never
said
sherlock
holmes
bending
forward
and
sinking
his
voice
have
you
never
heard
of
the
ku
klux
klan
i
never
have
holmes
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
upon
his
knee
here
it
is
said
he
presently
klux
klan
a
name
derived
from
the
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sound
produced
by
cocking
a
rifle
this
terrible
secret
society
was
formed
by
some
soldiers
in
the
southern
states
after
the
civil
war
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
country
notably
in
tennessee
louisiana
the
carolinas
georgia
and
florida
its
power
was
used
for
political
purposes
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the
negro
voters
and
the
murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
its
views
its
outrages
were
usually
preceded
by
a
warning
sent
to
the
marked
man
in
some
fantastic
but
generally
recognised
shape
a
sprig
of
in
some
parts
melon
seeds
or
orange
pips
in
others
on
receiving
this
the
victim
might
either
openly
abjure
his
former
ways
or
might
fly
from
the
country
if
he
braved
the
matter
out
death
would
unfailingly
come
upon
him
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
manner
so
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
society
and
so
systematic
its
methods
that
there
is
hardly
a
case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
impunity
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
perpetrators
for
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
south
eventually
in
the
year
the
movement
rather
suddenly
collapsed
although
there
have
been
sporadic
outbreaks
of
the
same
sort
since
that
date
you
will
observe
said
holmes
laying
down
the
volume
that
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
openshaw
from
america
with
their
papers
it
may
well
have
been
cause
and
effect
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
track
you
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
south
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
recovered
then
the
page
we
have
seen
is
such
as
we
might
expect
it
ran
if
i
remember
right
the
pips
to
a
b
and
c
that
is
sent
the
society
warning
to
them
then
there
are
successive
entries
that
a
and
b
cleared
or
left
the
country
and
finally
that
c
was
visited
with
i
fear
a
sinister
result
for
well
i
think
doctor
that
we
may
let
some
light
into
this
dark
place
and
i
believe
that
the
only
chance
young
openshaw
has
in
the
meantime
is
to
do
what
i
have
told
him
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
to
be
done
so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
it
had
cleared
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
a
subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
city
sherlock
holmes
was
already
at
breakfast
when
i
came
down
you
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you
said
he
i
have
i
foresee
a
very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
openshaw
what
steps
will
you
take
i
asked
it
will
very
much
depend
upon
the
results
of
my
first
inquiries
i
may
have
to
go
down
to
horsham
after
all
you
will
not
go
there
first
no
i
shall
commence
with
the
city
just
ring
the
bell
and
the
maid
will
bring
up
your
coffee
as
i
waited
i
lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it
it
rested
upon
a
heading
which
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
holmes
i
cried
you
are
too
late
ah
said
he
laying
down
his
cup
i
feared
as
much
how
was
it
done
he
spoke
calmly
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved
my
eye
caught
the
name
of
openshaw
and
the
heading
near
waterloo
bridge
here
is
the
account
between
nine
and
ten
last
night
cook
of
the
h
division
on
duty
near
waterloo
bridge
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
a
splash
in
the
water
the
night
however
was
extremely
dark
and
stormy
so
that
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect
a
rescue
the
alarm
however
was
given
and
by
the
aid
of
the
the
body
was
eventually
recovered
it
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
gentleman
whose
name
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
pocket
was
john
openshaw
and
whose
residence
is
near
horsham
it
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
waterloo
station
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
for
river
steamboats
the
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
violence
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
accident
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
we
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
holmes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
that
hurts
my
pride
watson
he
said
at
last
it
is
a
petty
feeling
no
doubt
but
it
hurts
my
pride
it
becomes
a
personal
matter
with
me
now
and
if
god
sends
me
health
i
shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
gang
that
he
should
come
to
me
for
help
and
that
i
should
send
him
away
to
his
death
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
with
a
flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and
a
nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin
hands
they
must
be
cunning
devils
he
exclaimed
at
last
how
could
they
have
decoyed
him
down
there
the
embankment
is
not
on
the
direct
line
to
the
station
the
bridge
no
doubt
was
too
crowded
even
on
such
a
night
for
their
purpose
well
watson
we
shall
see
who
will
win
in
the
long
run
i
am
going
out
now
to
the
police
no
i
shall
be
my
own
police
when
i
have
spun
the
web
they
may
take
the
flies
but
not
before
all
day
i
was
engaged
in
my
professional
work
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
i
returned
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
had
not
come
back
yet
it
was
nearly
ten
before
he
entered
looking
pale
and
worn
he
walked
up
to
the
sideboard
and
tearing
a
piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
voraciously
washing
it
down
with
a
long
draught
of
water
you
are
hungry
i
remarked
starving
it
had
escaped
my
memory
i
have
had
nothing
since
breakfast
nothing
not
a
bite
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
and
how
have
you
succeeded
well
you
have
a
clue
i
have
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
young
openshaw
shall
not
long
remain
unavenged
why
watson
let
us
put
their
own
devilish
upon
them
it
is
well
thought
of
what
do
you
mean
he
took
an
orange
from
the
cupboard
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
he
squeezed
out
the
pips
upon
the
table
of
these
he
took
five
and
thrust
them
into
an
envelope
on
the
inside
of
the
flap
he
wrote
for
j
o
then
he
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
captain
james
calhoun
barque
star
savannah
georgia
that
will
await
him
when
he
enters
port
said
he
chuckling
it
may
give
him
a
sleepless
night
he
will
find
it
as
sure
a
precursor
of
his
fate
as
openshaw
did
before
him
and
who
is
this
captain
calhoun
the
leader
of
the
gang
i
shall
have
the
others
but
he
first
how
did
you
trace
it
then
he
took
a
large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
all
covered
with
dates
and
names
i
have
spent
the
whole
day
said
he
over
lloyd
registers
and
files
of
the
old
papers
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
pondicherry
in
january
and
february
in
there
were
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
months
of
these
one
the
star
instantly
attracted
my
attention
since
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared
from
london
the
name
is
that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
union
texas
i
think
i
was
not
and
am
not
sure
which
but
i
knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
american
origin
what
then
i
searched
the
dundee
records
and
when
i
found
that
the
barque
star
was
there
in
january
my
suspicion
became
a
certainty
i
then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
london
yes
the
star
had
arrived
here
last
week
i
went
down
to
the
albert
dock
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
morning
homeward
bound
to
savannah
i
wired
to
gravesend
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
ago
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
goodwins
and
not
very
far
from
the
isle
of
wight
what
will
you
do
then
oh
i
have
my
hand
upon
him
he
and
the
two
mates
are
as
i
learn
the
only
americans
in
the
ship
the
others
are
finns
and
germans
i
know
also
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship
last
night
i
had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
cargo
by
the
time
that
their
reaches
savannah
the
will
have
carried
this
letter
and
the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
savannah
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon
a
charge
of
murder
there
is
ever
a
flaw
however
in
the
best
laid
of
human
plans
and
the
murderers
of
john
openshaw
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
pips
which
would
show
them
that
another
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
themselves
was
upon
their
track
very
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
year
we
waited
long
for
news
of
the
lone
star
of
savannah
but
none
ever
reached
us
we
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
atlantic
a
shattered
of
a
boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of
a
wave
with
the
letters
carved
upon
it
and
that
is
all
which
we
shall
ever
know
of
the
fate
of
the
lone
star
adventure
vi
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
isa
whitney
brother
of
the
late
elias
whitney
principal
of
the
theological
college
of
george
was
much
addicted
to
opium
the
habit
grew
upon
him
as
i
understand
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
college
for
having
read
de
quincey
description
of
his
dreams
and
sensations
he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with
laudanum
in
an
attempt
to
produce
the
same
effects
he
found
as
so
many
more
have
done
that
the
practice
is
easier
to
attain
than
to
get
rid
of
and
for
many
years
he
continued
to
be
a
slave
to
the
drug
an
object
of
mingled
horror
and
pity
to
his
friends
and
relatives
i
can
see
him
now
with
yellow
pasty
face
drooping
lids
and
pupils
all
huddled
in
a
chair
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
a
noble
man
one
night
it
was
in
june
there
came
a
ring
to
my
bell
about
the
hour
when
a
man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
clock
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
my
wife
laid
her
down
in
her
lap
and
made
a
little
face
of
disappointment
a
patient
said
she
you
have
to
go
out
i
groaned
for
i
was
newly
come
back
from
a
weary
day
we
heard
the
door
open
a
few
hurried
words
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
linoleum
our
own
door
flew
open
and
a
lady
clad
in
some
stuff
with
a
black
veil
entered
the
room
you
will
excuse
my
calling
so
late
she
began
and
then
suddenly
losing
her
she
ran
forward
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife
neck
and
sobbed
upon
her
shoulder
oh
i
in
such
trouble
she
cried
i
do
so
want
a
little
help
why
said
my
wife
pulling
up
her
veil
it
is
kate
whitney
how
you
startled
me
kate
i
had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
in
i
did
know
what
to
do
so
i
came
straight
to
you
that
was
always
the
way
folk
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to
a
it
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
come
now
you
must
have
some
wine
and
water
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
it
or
should
you
rather
that
i
sent
james
off
to
bed
oh
no
no
i
want
the
doctor
advice
and
help
too
it
about
isa
he
has
not
been
home
for
two
days
i
am
so
frightened
about
him
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband
trouble
to
me
as
a
doctor
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
companion
we
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
find
did
she
know
where
her
husband
was
was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
her
it
seems
that
it
was
she
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
had
when
the
fit
was
on
him
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
city
hitherto
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
day
and
he
had
come
back
twitching
and
shattered
in
the
evening
but
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
hours
and
he
lay
there
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
docks
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
effects
there
he
was
to
be
found
she
was
sure
of
it
at
the
bar
of
gold
in
upper
swandam
lane
but
what
was
she
to
do
how
could
she
a
young
and
timid
woman
make
her
way
into
such
a
place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
him
there
was
the
case
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it
might
i
not
escort
her
to
this
place
and
then
as
a
second
thought
why
should
she
come
at
all
i
was
isa
whitney
medical
adviser
and
as
such
i
had
influence
over
him
i
could
manage
it
better
if
i
were
alone
i
promised
her
on
my
word
that
i
would
send
him
home
in
a
cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
me
and
so
in
ten
minutes
i
had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
behind
me
and
was
speeding
eastward
in
a
hansom
on
a
strange
errand
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
be
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
adventure
upper
swandam
lane
is
a
vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
london
bridge
between
a
and
a
approached
by
a
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
black
gap
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
i
found
the
den
of
which
i
was
in
search
ordering
my
cab
to
wait
i
passed
down
the
steps
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
feet
and
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
above
the
door
i
found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into
a
long
low
room
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
smoke
and
terraced
with
wooden
berths
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
ship
through
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch
a
glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
poses
bowed
shoulders
bent
knees
heads
thrown
back
and
chins
pointing
upward
with
here
and
there
a
dark
eye
turned
upon
the
newcomer
out
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
light
now
bright
now
faint
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
pipes
the
most
lay
silent
but
some
muttered
to
themselves
and
others
talked
together
in
a
strange
low
monotonous
voice
their
conversation
coming
in
gushes
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
silence
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
neighbour
at
the
farther
end
was
a
small
brazier
of
burning
charcoal
beside
which
on
a
wooden
stool
there
sat
a
tall
thin
old
man
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
fists
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
staring
into
the
fire
as
i
entered
a
sallow
malay
attendant
had
hurried
up
with
a
pipe
for
me
and
a
supply
of
the
drug
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
berth
thank
you
i
have
not
come
to
stay
said
i
there
is
a
friend
of
mine
here
isa
whitney
and
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
there
was
a
movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
right
and
peering
through
the
gloom
i
saw
whitney
pale
haggard
and
unkempt
staring
out
at
me
my
god
it
watson
said
he
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
reaction
with
every
nerve
in
a
twitter
i
say
watson
what
is
it
nearly
eleven
of
what
day
of
friday
june
good
heavens
i
thought
it
was
wednesday
it
is
wednesday
what
want
to
frighten
a
chap
for
he
sank
his
face
onto
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
in
a
high
treble
key
i
tell
you
that
it
is
friday
man
your
wife
has
been
waiting
this
two
days
for
you
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
so
i
am
but
you
got
mixed
watson
for
i
have
only
been
here
a
few
hours
three
pipes
four
pipes
i
forget
how
many
but
go
home
with
you
i
would
frighten
kate
poor
little
kate
give
me
your
hand
have
you
a
cab
yes
i
have
one
waiting
then
i
shall
go
in
it
but
i
must
owe
something
find
what
i
owe
watson
i
am
all
off
colour
i
can
do
nothing
for
myself
i
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
sleepers
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
vile
stupefying
fumes
of
the
drug
and
looking
about
for
the
manager
as
i
passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier
i
felt
a
sudden
pluck
at
my
skirt
and
a
low
voice
whispered
walk
past
me
and
then
look
back
at
me
the
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
ear
i
glanced
down
they
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
side
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
ever
very
thin
very
wrinkled
bent
with
age
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
knees
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
fingers
i
took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
back
it
took
all
my
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into
a
cry
of
astonishment
he
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but
i
his
form
had
filled
out
his
wrinkles
were
gone
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
fire
and
there
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
surprise
was
none
other
than
sherlock
holmes
he
made
a
slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
him
and
instantly
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
more
subsided
into
a
doddering
senility
holmes
i
whispered
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
den
as
low
as
you
can
he
answered
i
have
excellent
ears
if
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours
i
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
i
have
a
cab
outside
then
pray
send
him
home
in
it
you
may
safely
trust
him
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
mischief
i
should
recommend
you
also
to
send
a
note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
me
if
you
will
wait
outside
i
shall
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
sherlock
holmes
requests
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
definite
and
put
forward
with
such
a
quiet
air
of
mastery
i
felt
however
that
when
whitney
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
accomplished
and
for
the
rest
i
could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
existence
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
written
my
note
paid
whitney
bill
led
him
out
to
the
cab
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
darkness
in
a
very
short
time
a
decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
den
and
i
was
walking
down
the
street
with
sherlock
holmes
for
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with
a
bent
back
and
an
uncertain
foot
then
glancing
quickly
round
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
i
suppose
watson
said
he
that
you
imagine
that
i
have
added
to
cocaine
injections
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
views
i
was
certainly
surprised
to
find
you
there
but
not
more
so
than
i
to
find
you
i
came
to
find
a
friend
and
i
to
find
an
enemy
an
enemy
yes
one
of
my
natural
enemies
or
shall
i
say
my
natural
prey
briefly
watson
i
am
in
the
midst
of
a
very
remarkable
inquiry
and
i
have
hoped
to
find
a
clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
sots
as
i
have
done
before
now
had
i
been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth
an
hour
purchase
for
i
have
used
it
before
now
for
my
own
purposes
and
the
rascally
lascar
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
me
there
is
a
at
the
back
of
that
building
near
the
corner
of
paul
wharf
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
nights
what
you
do
not
mean
bodies
ay
bodies
watson
we
should
be
rich
men
if
we
had
pounds
for
every
poor
devil
who
has
been
done
to
death
in
that
den
it
is
the
vilest
on
the
whole
riverside
and
i
fear
that
neville
clair
has
entered
it
never
to
leave
it
more
but
our
trap
should
be
here
he
put
his
two
forefingers
between
his
teeth
and
whistled
shrilly
a
signal
which
was
answered
by
a
similar
whistle
from
the
distance
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
horses
hoofs
now
watson
said
holmes
as
a
tall
dashed
up
through
the
gloom
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels
of
yellow
light
from
its
side
lanterns
you
come
with
me
wo
you
if
i
can
be
of
use
oh
a
trusty
comrade
is
always
of
use
and
a
chronicler
still
more
so
my
room
at
the
cedars
is
a
one
the
cedars
yes
that
is
clair
house
i
am
staying
there
while
i
conduct
the
inquiry
where
is
it
then
near
lee
in
kent
we
have
a
drive
before
us
but
i
am
all
in
the
dark
of
course
you
are
you
know
all
about
it
presently
jump
up
here
all
right
john
we
shall
not
need
you
here
half
a
crown
look
out
for
me
about
eleven
give
her
her
head
so
long
then
he
flicked
the
horse
with
his
whip
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
streets
which
widened
gradually
until
we
were
flying
across
a
broad
balustraded
bridge
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
us
beyond
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
regular
footfall
of
the
policeman
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
revellers
a
dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
and
a
star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds
holmes
drove
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
lost
in
thought
while
i
sat
beside
him
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
sorely
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts
we
had
driven
several
miles
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
villas
when
he
shook
himself
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
best
you
have
a
grand
gift
of
silence
watson
said
he
it
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as
a
companion
my
word
it
is
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
i
was
wondering
what
i
should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
when
she
meets
me
at
the
door
you
forget
that
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
lee
it
seems
absurdly
simple
and
yet
somehow
i
can
get
nothing
to
go
upon
there
plenty
of
thread
no
doubt
but
i
ca
get
the
end
of
it
into
my
hand
now
i
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
you
watson
and
maybe
you
can
see
a
spark
where
all
is
dark
to
me
proceed
then
some
years
ago
to
be
definite
in
may
there
came
to
lee
a
gentleman
neville
clair
by
name
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
he
took
a
large
villa
laid
out
the
grounds
very
nicely
and
lived
generally
in
good
style
by
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
local
brewer
by
whom
he
now
has
two
children
he
had
no
occupation
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as
a
rule
in
the
morning
returning
by
the
from
cannon
street
every
night
clair
is
now
years
of
age
is
a
man
of
temperate
habits
a
good
husband
a
very
affectionate
father
and
a
man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
him
i
may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
moment
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
amount
to
pounds
while
he
has
pounds
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
capital
and
counties
bank
there
is
no
reason
therefore
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
mind
last
monday
neville
clair
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
usual
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
perform
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home
a
box
of
bricks
now
by
the
merest
chance
his
wife
received
a
telegram
upon
this
same
monday
very
shortly
after
his
departure
to
the
effect
that
a
small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
aberdeen
shipping
company
now
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
london
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
fresno
street
which
branches
out
of
upper
swandam
lane
where
you
found
me
clair
had
her
lunch
started
for
the
city
did
some
shopping
proceeded
to
the
company
office
got
her
packet
and
found
herself
at
exactly
walking
through
swandam
lane
on
her
way
back
to
the
station
have
you
followed
me
so
far
it
is
very
clear
if
you
remember
monday
was
an
exceedingly
hot
day
and
clair
walked
slowly
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
cab
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
herself
while
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
swandam
lane
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
cry
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
beckoning
to
her
from
a
window
the
window
was
open
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
face
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
agitated
he
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
her
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
behind
one
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
coat
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
in
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
necktie
convinced
that
something
was
amiss
with
him
she
rushed
down
the
steps
for
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
and
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
however
she
met
this
lascar
scoundrel
of
whom
i
have
spoken
who
thrust
her
back
and
aided
by
a
dane
who
acts
as
assistant
there
pushed
her
out
into
the
street
filled
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
fears
she
rushed
down
the
lane
and
by
rare
met
in
fresno
street
a
number
of
constables
with
an
inspector
all
on
their
way
to
their
beat
the
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
back
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
proprietor
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
clair
had
last
been
seen
there
was
no
sign
of
him
there
in
fact
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save
a
crippled
wretch
of
hideous
aspect
who
it
seems
made
his
home
there
both
he
and
the
lascar
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
afternoon
so
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
staggered
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
clair
had
been
deluded
when
with
a
cry
she
sprang
at
a
small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
it
out
there
fell
a
cascade
of
children
bricks
it
was
the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
home
this
discovery
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
showed
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
serious
the
rooms
were
carefully
examined
and
results
all
pointed
to
an
abominable
crime
the
front
room
was
plainly
furnished
as
a
and
led
into
a
small
bedroom
which
looked
out
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
wharves
between
the
wharf
and
the
bedroom
window
is
a
narrow
strip
which
is
dry
at
low
tide
but
is
covered
at
high
tide
with
at
least
four
and
a
half
feet
of
water
the
bedroom
window
was
a
broad
one
and
opened
from
below
on
examination
traces
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
windowsill
and
several
scattered
drops
were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
bedroom
thrust
away
behind
a
curtain
in
the
front
room
were
all
the
clothes
of
neville
clair
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
his
boots
his
socks
his
hat
and
his
watch
all
were
there
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
upon
any
of
these
garments
and
there
were
no
other
traces
of
neville
clair
out
of
the
window
he
must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
discovered
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little
promise
that
he
could
save
himself
by
swimming
for
the
tide
was
at
its
very
highest
at
the
moment
of
the
tragedy
and
now
as
to
the
villains
who
seemed
to
be
immediately
implicated
in
the
matter
the
lascar
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
the
vilest
antecedents
but
as
by
clair
story
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within
a
very
few
seconds
of
her
husband
appearance
at
the
window
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
crime
his
defence
was
one
of
absolute
ignorance
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
hugh
boone
his
lodger
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
gentleman
clothes
so
much
for
the
lascar
manager
now
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the
opium
den
and
who
was
certainly
the
last
human
being
whose
eyes
rested
upon
neville
clair
his
name
is
hugh
boone
and
his
hideous
face
is
one
which
is
familiar
to
every
man
who
goes
much
to
the
city
he
is
a
professional
beggar
though
in
order
to
avoid
the
police
regulations
he
pretends
to
a
small
trade
in
wax
vestas
some
little
distance
down
threadneedle
street
upon
the
side
there
is
as
you
may
have
remarked
a
small
angle
in
the
wall
here
it
is
that
this
creature
takes
his
daily
seat
with
his
tiny
stock
of
matches
on
his
lap
and
as
he
is
a
piteous
spectacle
a
small
rain
of
charity
descends
into
the
greasy
leather
cap
which
lies
upon
the
pavement
beside
him
i
have
watched
the
fellow
more
than
once
before
ever
i
thought
of
making
his
professional
acquaintance
and
i
have
been
surprised
at
the
harvest
which
he
has
reaped
in
a
short
time
his
appearance
you
see
is
so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
him
a
shock
of
orange
hair
a
pale
face
disfigured
by
a
horrible
scar
which
by
its
contraction
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
lip
a
bulldog
chin
and
a
pair
of
very
penetrating
dark
eyes
which
present
a
singular
contrast
to
the
colour
of
his
hair
all
mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd
of
mendicants
and
so
too
does
his
wit
for
he
is
ever
ready
with
a
reply
to
any
piece
of
chaff
which
may
be
thrown
at
him
by
the
this
is
the
man
whom
we
now
learn
to
have
been
the
lodger
at
the
opium
den
and
to
have
been
the
last
man
to
see
the
gentleman
of
whom
we
are
in
quest
but
a
cripple
said
i
what
could
he
have
done
against
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
he
is
a
cripple
in
the
sense
that
he
walks
with
a
limp
but
in
other
respects
he
appears
to
be
a
powerful
and
man
surely
your
medical
experience
would
tell
you
watson
that
weakness
in
one
limb
is
often
compensated
for
by
exceptional
strength
in
the
others
pray
continue
your
narrative
clair
had
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
upon
the
window
and
she
was
escorted
home
in
a
cab
by
the
police
as
her
presence
could
be
of
no
help
to
them
in
their
investigations
inspector
barton
who
had
charge
of
the
case
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
premises
but
without
finding
anything
which
threw
any
light
upon
the
matter
one
mistake
had
been
made
in
not
arresting
boone
instantly
as
he
was
allowed
some
few
minutes
during
which
he
might
have
communicated
with
his
friend
the
lascar
but
this
fault
was
soon
remedied
and
he
was
seized
and
searched
without
anything
being
found
which
could
incriminate
him
there
were
it
is
true
some
upon
his
right
but
he
pointed
to
his
which
had
been
cut
near
the
nail
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
there
adding
that
he
had
been
to
the
window
not
long
before
and
that
the
stains
which
had
been
observed
there
came
doubtless
from
the
same
source
he
denied
strenuously
having
ever
seen
neville
clair
and
swore
that
the
presence
of
the
clothes
in
his
room
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
the
police
as
to
clair
assertion
that
she
had
actually
seen
her
husband
at
the
window
he
declared
that
she
must
have
been
either
mad
or
dreaming
he
was
removed
loudly
protesting
to
the
while
the
inspector
remained
upon
the
premises
in
the
hope
that
the
ebbing
tide
might
afford
some
fresh
clue
and
it
did
though
they
hardly
found
upon
the
what
they
had
feared
to
find
it
was
neville
clair
coat
and
not
neville
clair
which
lay
uncovered
as
the
tide
receded
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
in
the
pockets
i
can
not
imagine
no
i
do
think
you
would
guess
every
pocket
stuffed
with
pennies
and
pennies
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
it
had
not
been
swept
away
by
the
tide
but
a
human
body
is
a
different
matter
there
is
a
fierce
eddy
between
the
wharf
and
the
house
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
river
but
i
understand
that
all
the
other
clothes
were
found
in
the
room
would
the
body
be
dressed
in
a
coat
alone
no
sir
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
enough
suppose
that
this
man
boone
had
thrust
neville
clair
through
the
window
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
deed
what
would
he
do
then
it
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
garments
he
would
seize
the
coat
then
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
out
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
sink
he
has
little
time
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
up
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
lascar
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
street
there
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
he
rushes
to
some
secret
hoard
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
beggary
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the
coat
sinking
he
throws
it
out
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
below
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
appeared
it
certainly
sounds
feasible
well
we
will
take
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
for
want
of
a
better
boone
as
i
have
told
you
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
station
but
it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
him
he
had
for
years
been
known
as
a
professional
beggar
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been
a
very
quiet
and
innocent
one
there
the
matter
stands
at
present
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
solved
what
neville
clair
was
doing
in
the
opium
den
what
happened
to
him
when
there
where
is
he
now
and
what
hugh
boone
had
to
do
with
his
disappearance
are
all
as
far
from
a
solution
as
ever
i
confess
that
i
can
not
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
difficulties
while
sherlock
holmes
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
events
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
behind
and
we
rattled
along
with
a
country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
us
just
as
he
finished
however
we
drove
through
two
scattered
villages
where
a
few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
windows
we
are
on
the
outskirts
of
lee
said
my
companion
we
have
touched
on
three
english
counties
in
our
short
drive
starting
in
middlesex
passing
over
an
angle
of
surrey
and
ending
in
kent
see
that
light
among
the
trees
that
is
the
cedars
and
beside
that
lamp
sits
a
woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
already
i
have
little
doubt
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse
feet
but
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
baker
street
i
asked
because
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
here
clair
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
disposal
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but
a
welcome
for
my
friend
and
colleague
i
hate
to
meet
her
watson
when
i
have
no
news
of
her
husband
here
we
are
whoa
there
whoa
we
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
grounds
a
had
run
out
to
the
horse
head
and
springing
down
i
followed
holmes
up
the
small
winding
which
led
to
the
house
as
we
approached
the
door
flew
open
and
a
little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
opening
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
soie
with
a
touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
wrists
she
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
light
one
hand
upon
the
door
one
in
her
eagerness
her
body
slightly
bent
her
head
and
face
protruded
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
lips
a
standing
question
well
she
cried
well
and
then
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
us
she
gave
a
cry
of
hope
which
sank
into
a
groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
good
news
none
no
bad
no
thank
god
for
that
but
come
in
you
must
be
weary
for
you
have
had
a
long
day
this
is
my
friend
watson
he
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
cases
and
a
lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with
this
investigation
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
she
pressing
my
hand
warmly
you
will
i
am
sure
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
arrangements
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
us
my
dear
madam
said
i
i
am
an
old
campaigner
and
if
i
were
not
i
can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
needed
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
here
i
shall
be
indeed
happy
now
sherlock
holmes
said
the
lady
as
we
entered
a
upon
the
table
of
which
a
cold
supper
had
been
laid
out
i
should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
questions
to
which
i
beg
that
you
will
give
a
plain
answer
certainly
madam
do
not
trouble
about
my
feelings
i
am
not
hysterical
nor
given
to
fainting
i
simply
wish
to
hear
your
real
real
opinion
upon
what
point
in
your
heart
of
hearts
do
you
think
that
neville
is
alive
sherlock
holmes
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
question
frankly
now
she
repeated
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in
a
frankly
then
madam
i
do
not
you
think
that
he
is
dead
i
do
murdered
i
do
say
that
perhaps
and
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
death
on
monday
then
perhaps
holmes
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
sherlock
holmes
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
galvanised
what
he
roared
yes
she
stood
smiling
holding
up
a
little
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
may
i
see
it
certainly
he
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
eagerness
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
intently
i
had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
shoulder
the
envelope
was
a
very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
gravesend
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
day
or
rather
of
the
day
before
for
it
was
considerably
after
midnight
coarse
writing
murmured
holmes
surely
this
is
not
your
husband
writing
madam
no
but
the
enclosure
is
i
perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
address
how
can
you
tell
that
the
name
you
see
is
in
perfectly
black
ink
which
has
dried
itself
the
rest
is
of
the
greyish
colour
which
shows
that
has
been
used
if
it
had
been
written
straight
off
and
then
blotted
none
would
be
of
a
deep
black
shade
this
man
has
written
the
name
and
there
has
then
been
a
pause
before
he
wrote
the
address
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it
it
is
of
course
a
trifle
but
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
trifles
let
us
now
see
the
letter
ha
there
has
been
an
enclosure
here
yes
there
was
a
ring
his
and
you
are
sure
that
this
is
your
husband
hand
one
of
his
hands
one
his
hand
when
he
wrote
hurriedly
it
is
very
unlike
his
usual
writing
and
yet
i
know
it
well
do
not
be
frightened
all
will
come
well
there
is
a
huge
error
which
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
rectify
wait
in
neville
written
in
pencil
upon
the
of
a
book
octavo
size
no
hum
posted
in
gravesend
by
a
man
with
a
dirty
thumb
ha
and
the
flap
has
been
gummed
if
i
am
not
very
much
in
error
by
a
person
who
had
been
chewing
tobacco
and
you
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
hand
madam
none
neville
wrote
those
words
and
they
were
posted
at
gravesend
well
clair
the
clouds
lighten
though
i
should
not
venture
to
say
that
the
danger
is
over
but
he
must
be
alive
mr
holmes
unless
this
is
a
clever
forgery
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
the
ring
after
all
proves
nothing
it
may
have
been
taken
from
him
no
no
it
is
it
is
his
very
own
writing
very
well
it
may
however
have
been
written
on
monday
and
only
posted
that
is
possible
if
so
much
may
have
happened
between
oh
you
must
not
discourage
me
holmes
i
know
that
all
is
well
with
him
there
is
so
keen
a
sympathy
between
us
that
i
should
know
if
evil
came
upon
him
on
the
very
day
that
i
saw
him
last
he
cut
himself
in
the
bedroom
and
yet
i
in
the
rushed
upstairs
instantly
with
the
utmost
certainty
that
something
had
happened
do
you
think
that
i
would
respond
to
such
a
trifle
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
his
death
i
have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
the
impression
of
a
woman
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion
of
an
analytical
reasoner
and
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have
a
very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
view
but
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
letters
why
should
he
remain
away
from
you
i
can
not
imagine
it
is
unthinkable
and
on
monday
he
made
no
remarks
before
leaving
you
no
and
you
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
swandam
lane
very
much
so
was
the
window
open
yes
then
he
might
have
called
to
you
he
might
he
only
as
i
understand
gave
an
inarticulate
cry
yes
a
call
for
help
you
thought
yes
he
waved
his
hands
but
it
might
have
been
a
cry
of
surprise
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
might
cause
him
to
throw
up
his
hands
it
is
possible
and
you
thought
he
was
pulled
back
he
disappeared
so
suddenly
he
might
have
leaped
back
you
did
not
see
anyone
else
in
the
room
no
but
this
horrible
man
confessed
to
having
been
there
and
the
lascar
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
quite
so
your
husband
as
far
as
you
could
see
had
his
ordinary
clothes
on
but
without
his
collar
or
tie
i
distinctly
saw
his
bare
throat
had
he
ever
spoken
of
swandam
lane
never
had
he
ever
showed
any
signs
of
having
taken
opium
never
thank
you
clair
those
are
the
principal
points
about
which
i
wished
to
be
absolutely
clear
we
shall
now
have
a
little
supper
and
then
retire
for
we
may
have
a
very
busy
day
a
large
and
comfortable
room
had
been
placed
at
our
disposal
and
i
was
quickly
between
the
sheets
for
i
was
weary
after
my
night
of
adventure
sherlock
holmes
was
a
man
however
who
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
mind
would
go
for
days
and
even
for
a
week
without
rest
turning
it
over
rearranging
his
facts
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
insufficient
it
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
sitting
he
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
put
on
a
large
blue
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
armchairs
with
these
he
constructed
a
sort
of
eastern
divan
upon
which
he
perched
himself
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and
a
box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
i
saw
him
sitting
there
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
lips
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
him
silent
motionless
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
aquiline
features
so
he
sat
as
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
so
he
sat
when
a
sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
up
and
i
found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
apartment
the
pipe
was
still
between
his
lips
the
smoke
still
curled
upward
and
the
room
was
full
of
a
dense
tobacco
haze
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which
i
had
seen
upon
the
previous
night
awake
watson
he
asked
yes
game
for
a
morning
drive
certainly
then
dress
no
one
is
stirring
yet
but
i
know
where
the
sleeps
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
seemed
a
different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
night
as
i
dressed
i
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
stirring
it
was
minutes
past
four
i
had
hardly
finished
when
holmes
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
horse
i
want
to
test
a
little
theory
of
mine
said
he
pulling
on
his
boots
i
think
watson
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
europe
i
deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
charing
cross
but
i
think
i
have
the
key
of
the
affair
now
and
where
is
it
i
asked
smiling
in
the
bathroom
he
answered
oh
yes
i
am
not
joking
he
continued
seeing
my
look
of
incredulity
i
have
just
been
there
and
i
have
taken
it
out
and
i
have
got
it
in
this
gladstone
bag
come
on
my
boy
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
lock
we
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
possible
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine
in
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
trap
with
the
waiting
at
the
head
we
both
sprang
in
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
london
road
a
few
country
carts
were
stirring
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
metropolis
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in
a
dream
it
has
been
in
some
points
a
singular
case
said
holmes
flicking
the
horse
on
into
a
gallop
i
confess
that
i
have
been
as
blind
as
a
mole
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
all
in
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
surrey
side
passing
down
the
waterloo
bridge
road
we
crossed
over
the
river
and
dashing
up
wellington
street
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
bow
street
sherlock
holmes
was
well
known
to
the
force
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
him
one
of
them
held
the
horse
head
while
the
other
led
us
in
who
is
on
duty
asked
holmes
inspector
bradstreet
sir
ah
bradstreet
how
are
you
a
tall
stout
official
had
come
down
the
passage
in
a
peaked
cap
and
frogged
jacket
i
wish
to
have
a
quiet
word
with
you
bradstreet
certainly
holmes
step
into
my
room
here
it
was
a
small
room
with
a
huge
ledger
upon
the
table
and
a
telephone
projecting
from
the
wall
the
inspector
sat
down
at
his
desk
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
holmes
i
called
about
that
beggarman
boone
the
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
neville
clair
of
lee
yes
he
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
inquiries
so
i
heard
you
have
him
here
in
the
cells
is
he
quiet
oh
he
gives
no
trouble
but
he
is
a
dirty
scoundrel
dirty
yes
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
hands
and
his
face
is
as
black
as
a
tinker
well
when
once
his
case
has
been
settled
he
will
have
a
regular
prison
bath
and
i
think
if
you
saw
him
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
it
i
should
like
to
see
him
very
much
would
you
that
is
easily
done
come
this
way
you
can
leave
your
bag
no
i
think
that
i
take
it
very
good
come
this
way
if
you
please
he
led
us
down
a
passage
opened
a
barred
door
passed
down
a
winding
stair
and
brought
us
to
a
whitewashed
corridor
with
a
line
of
doors
on
each
side
the
third
on
the
right
is
his
said
the
inspector
here
it
is
he
quietly
shot
back
a
panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
through
he
is
asleep
said
he
you
can
see
him
very
well
we
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
grating
the
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
us
in
a
very
deep
sleep
breathing
slowly
and
heavily
he
was
a
man
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
calling
with
a
coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
coat
he
was
as
the
inspector
had
said
extremely
dirty
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
ugliness
a
broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
chin
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
lip
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in
a
perpetual
snarl
a
shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
forehead
he
a
beauty
is
he
said
the
inspector
he
certainly
needs
a
wash
remarked
holmes
i
had
an
idea
that
he
might
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
me
he
opened
the
gladstone
bag
as
he
spoke
and
took
out
to
my
astonishment
a
very
large
he
he
you
are
a
funny
one
chuckled
the
inspector
now
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
quietly
we
will
soon
make
him
cut
a
much
more
respectable
figure
well
i
do
know
why
not
said
the
inspector
he
look
a
credit
to
the
bow
street
cells
does
he
he
slipped
his
key
into
the
lock
and
we
all
very
quietly
entered
the
cell
the
sleeper
half
turned
and
then
settled
down
once
more
into
a
deep
slumber
holmes
stooped
to
the
moistened
his
sponge
and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down
the
prisoner
face
let
me
introduce
you
he
shouted
to
neville
clair
of
lee
in
the
county
of
kent
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
such
a
sight
the
man
face
peeled
off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from
a
tree
gone
was
the
coarse
brown
tint
gone
too
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
across
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
face
a
twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
hair
and
there
sitting
up
in
his
bed
was
a
pale
man
and
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
bewilderment
then
suddenly
realising
the
exposure
he
broke
into
a
scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
pillow
great
heavens
cried
the
inspector
it
is
indeed
the
missing
man
i
know
him
from
the
photograph
the
prisoner
turned
with
the
reckless
air
of
a
man
who
abandons
himself
to
his
destiny
be
it
so
said
he
and
pray
what
am
i
charged
with
with
making
away
with
neville
oh
come
you
ca
be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make
a
case
of
attempted
suicide
of
it
said
the
inspector
with
a
grin
well
i
have
been
years
in
the
force
but
this
really
takes
the
cake
if
i
am
neville
clair
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
therefore
i
am
illegally
detained
no
crime
but
a
very
great
error
has
been
committed
said
holmes
you
would
have
done
better
to
have
trusted
your
wife
it
was
not
the
wife
it
was
the
children
groaned
the
prisoner
god
help
me
i
would
not
have
them
ashamed
of
their
father
my
god
what
an
exposure
what
can
i
do
sherlock
holmes
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
if
you
leave
it
to
a
court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
up
said
he
of
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
publicity
on
the
other
hand
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against
you
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into
the
papers
inspector
bradstreet
would
i
am
sure
make
notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
authorities
the
case
would
then
never
go
into
court
at
all
god
bless
you
cried
the
prisoner
passionately
i
would
have
endured
imprisonment
ay
even
execution
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret
as
a
family
blot
to
my
children
you
are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard
my
story
my
father
was
a
schoolmaster
in
chesterfield
where
i
received
an
excellent
education
i
travelled
in
my
youth
took
to
the
stage
and
finally
became
a
reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
london
one
day
my
editor
wished
to
have
a
series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
metropolis
and
i
volunteered
to
supply
them
there
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
started
it
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that
i
could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
articles
when
an
actor
i
had
of
course
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
up
and
had
been
famous
in
the
for
my
skill
i
took
advantage
now
of
my
attainments
i
painted
my
face
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible
i
made
a
good
scar
and
fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in
a
twist
by
the
aid
of
a
small
slip
of
plaster
then
with
a
red
head
of
hair
and
an
appropriate
dress
i
took
my
station
in
the
business
part
of
the
city
ostensibly
as
a
but
really
as
a
beggar
for
seven
hours
i
plied
my
trade
and
when
i
returned
home
in
the
evening
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
i
had
received
no
less
than
i
wrote
my
articles
and
thought
little
more
of
the
matter
until
some
time
later
i
backed
a
bill
for
a
friend
and
had
a
writ
served
upon
me
for
pounds
i
was
at
my
wit
end
where
to
get
the
money
but
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me
i
begged
a
grace
from
the
creditor
asked
for
a
holiday
from
my
employers
and
spent
the
time
in
begging
in
the
city
under
my
disguise
in
ten
days
i
had
the
money
and
had
paid
the
debt
well
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
settle
down
to
arduous
work
at
pounds
a
week
when
i
knew
that
i
could
earn
as
much
in
a
day
by
smearing
my
face
with
a
little
paint
laying
my
cap
on
the
ground
and
sitting
still
it
was
a
long
fight
between
my
pride
and
the
money
but
the
dollars
won
at
last
and
i
threw
up
reporting
and
sat
day
after
day
in
the
corner
which
i
had
first
chosen
inspiring
pity
by
my
ghastly
face
and
filling
my
pockets
with
coppers
only
one
man
knew
my
secret
he
was
the
keeper
of
a
low
den
in
which
i
used
to
lodge
in
swandam
lane
where
i
could
every
morning
emerge
as
a
squalid
beggar
and
in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into
a
man
about
town
this
fellow
a
lascar
was
well
paid
by
me
for
his
rooms
so
that
i
knew
that
my
secret
was
safe
in
his
possession
well
very
soon
i
found
that
i
was
saving
considerable
sums
of
money
i
do
not
mean
that
any
beggar
in
the
streets
of
london
could
earn
pounds
a
year
which
is
less
than
my
average
takings
but
i
had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
up
and
also
in
a
facility
of
repartee
which
improved
by
practice
and
made
me
quite
a
recognised
character
in
the
city
all
day
a
stream
of
pennies
varied
by
silver
poured
in
upon
me
and
it
was
a
very
bad
day
in
which
i
failed
to
take
pounds
as
i
grew
richer
i
grew
more
ambitious
took
a
house
in
the
country
and
eventually
married
without
anyone
having
a
suspicion
as
to
my
real
occupation
my
dear
wife
knew
that
i
had
business
in
the
city
she
little
knew
what
last
monday
i
had
finished
for
the
day
and
was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
street
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
me
i
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
face
and
rushing
to
my
confidant
the
lascar
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
me
i
heard
her
voice
downstairs
but
i
knew
that
she
could
not
ascend
swiftly
i
threw
off
my
clothes
pulled
on
those
of
a
beggar
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
wig
even
a
eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete
a
disguise
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
in
the
room
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
me
i
threw
open
the
window
reopening
by
my
violence
a
small
cut
which
i
had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
morning
then
i
seized
my
coat
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which
i
had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which
i
carried
my
takings
i
hurled
it
out
of
the
window
and
it
disappeared
into
the
thames
the
other
clothes
would
have
followed
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
rush
of
constables
up
the
stair
and
a
few
minutes
after
i
found
rather
i
confess
to
my
relief
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
neville
clair
i
was
arrested
as
his
murderer
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
explain
i
was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
possible
and
hence
my
preference
for
a
dirty
face
knowing
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
anxious
i
slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
lascar
at
a
moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
me
together
with
a
hurried
scrawl
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear
that
note
only
reached
her
yesterday
said
holmes
good
god
what
a
week
she
must
have
spent
the
police
have
watched
this
lascar
said
inspector
bradstreet
and
i
can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post
a
letter
unobserved
probably
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
his
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
days
that
was
it
said
holmes
nodding
approvingly
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
begging
many
times
but
what
was
a
fine
to
me
it
must
stop
here
however
said
bradstreet
if
the
police
are
to
hush
this
thing
up
there
must
be
no
more
of
hugh
boone
i
have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
which
a
man
can
take
in
that
case
i
think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
taken
but
if
you
are
found
again
then
all
must
come
out
i
am
sure
holmes
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
up
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
reach
your
results
i
reached
this
one
said
my
friend
by
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
shag
i
think
watson
that
if
we
drive
to
baker
street
we
shall
just
be
in
time
for
breakfast
vii
the
adventure
of
the
blue
carbuncle
i
had
called
upon
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
upon
the
second
morning
after
christmas
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
season
he
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in
a
purple
a
within
his
reach
upon
the
right
and
a
pile
of
crumpled
morning
papers
evidently
newly
studied
near
at
hand
beside
the
couch
was
a
wooden
chair
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung
a
very
seedy
and
disreputable
hat
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
cracked
in
several
places
a
lens
and
a
forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair
suggested
that
the
hat
had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
examination
you
are
engaged
said
i
perhaps
i
interrupt
you
not
at
all
i
am
glad
to
have
a
friend
with
whom
i
can
discuss
my
results
the
matter
is
a
perfectly
trivial
one
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
hat
but
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction
i
seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
fire
for
a
sharp
frost
had
set
in
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice
crystals
i
suppose
i
remarked
that
homely
as
it
looks
this
thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to
it
that
it
is
the
clue
which
will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of
some
crime
no
no
no
crime
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing
only
one
of
those
whimsical
little
incidents
which
will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each
other
within
the
space
of
a
few
square
miles
amid
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense
a
swarm
of
humanity
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
place
and
many
a
little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
criminal
we
have
already
had
experience
of
such
so
much
so
i
remarked
that
of
the
last
six
cases
which
i
have
added
to
my
notes
three
have
been
entirely
free
of
any
legal
crime
precisely
you
allude
to
my
attempt
to
recover
the
irene
adler
papers
to
the
singular
case
of
miss
mary
sutherland
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
well
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
category
you
know
peterson
the
commissionaire
yes
it
is
to
him
that
this
trophy
belongs
it
is
his
hat
no
no
he
found
it
its
owner
is
unknown
i
beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as
a
battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
problem
and
first
as
to
how
it
came
here
it
arrived
upon
christmas
morning
in
company
with
a
good
fat
goose
which
is
i
have
no
doubt
roasting
at
this
moment
in
front
of
fire
the
facts
are
these
about
four
on
christmas
morning
peterson
who
as
you
know
is
a
very
honest
fellow
was
returning
from
some
small
jollification
and
was
making
his
way
homeward
down
tottenham
court
road
in
front
of
him
he
saw
in
the
gaslight
a
tallish
man
walking
with
a
slight
stagger
and
carrying
a
white
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reached
the
corner
of
goodge
street
a
row
broke
out
between
this
stranger
and
a
little
knot
of
roughs
one
of
the
latter
knocked
off
the
man
hat
on
which
he
raised
his
stick
to
defend
himself
and
swinging
it
over
his
head
smashed
the
shop
window
behind
him
peterson
had
rushed
forward
to
protect
the
stranger
from
his
assailants
but
the
man
shocked
at
having
broken
the
window
and
seeing
an
person
in
uniform
rushing
towards
him
dropped
his
goose
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
amid
the
labyrinth
of
small
streets
which
lie
at
the
back
of
tottenham
court
road
the
roughs
had
also
fled
at
the
appearance
of
peterson
so
that
he
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
and
also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered
hat
and
a
most
unimpeachable
christmas
goose
which
surely
he
restored
to
their
owner
my
dear
fellow
there
lies
the
problem
it
is
true
that
henry
baker
was
printed
upon
a
small
card
which
was
tied
to
the
bird
left
leg
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
initials
b
are
legible
upon
the
lining
of
this
hat
but
as
there
are
some
thousands
of
bakers
and
some
hundreds
of
henry
bakers
in
this
city
of
ours
it
is
not
easy
to
restore
lost
property
to
any
one
of
them
what
then
did
peterson
do
he
brought
round
both
hat
and
goose
to
me
on
christmas
morning
knowing
that
even
the
smallest
problems
are
of
interest
to
me
the
goose
we
retained
until
this
morning
when
there
were
signs
that
in
spite
of
the
slight
frost
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
be
eaten
without
unnecessary
delay
its
finder
has
carried
it
off
therefore
to
fulfil
the
ultimate
destiny
of
a
goose
while
i
continue
to
retain
the
hat
of
the
unknown
gentleman
who
lost
his
christmas
dinner
did
he
not
advertise
no
then
what
clue
could
you
have
as
to
his
identity
only
as
much
as
we
can
deduce
from
his
hat
precisely
but
you
are
joking
what
can
you
gather
from
this
old
battered
felt
here
is
my
lens
you
know
my
methods
what
can
you
gather
yourself
as
to
the
individuality
of
the
man
who
has
worn
this
article
i
took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it
over
rather
ruefully
it
was
a
very
ordinary
black
hat
of
the
usual
round
shape
hard
and
much
the
worse
for
wear
the
lining
had
been
of
red
silk
but
was
a
good
deal
discoloured
there
was
no
name
but
as
holmes
had
remarked
the
initials
h
b
were
scrawled
upon
one
side
it
was
pierced
in
the
brim
for
a
but
the
elastic
was
missing
for
the
rest
it
was
cracked
exceedingly
dusty
and
spotted
in
several
places
although
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
to
hide
the
discoloured
patches
by
smearing
them
with
ink
i
can
see
nothing
said
i
handing
it
back
to
my
friend
on
the
contrary
watson
you
can
see
everything
you
fail
however
to
reason
from
what
you
see
you
are
too
timid
in
drawing
your
inferences
then
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
can
infer
from
this
hat
he
picked
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
in
the
peculiar
introspective
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
him
it
is
perhaps
less
suggestive
than
it
might
have
been
he
remarked
and
yet
there
are
a
few
inferences
which
are
very
distinct
and
a
few
others
which
represent
at
least
a
strong
balance
of
probability
that
the
man
was
highly
intellectual
is
of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
it
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
within
the
last
three
years
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
days
he
had
foresight
but
has
less
now
than
formerly
pointing
to
a
moral
retrogression
which
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
seems
to
indicate
some
evil
influence
probably
drink
at
work
upon
him
this
may
account
also
for
the
obvious
fact
that
his
wife
has
ceased
to
love
him
my
dear
holmes
he
has
however
retained
some
degree
of
he
continued
disregarding
my
remonstrance
he
is
a
man
who
leads
a
sedentary
life
goes
out
little
is
out
of
training
entirely
is
has
grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
days
and
which
he
anoints
with
these
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
hat
also
by
the
way
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he
has
gas
laid
on
in
his
house
you
are
certainly
joking
holmes
not
in
the
least
is
it
possible
that
even
now
when
i
give
you
these
results
you
are
unable
to
see
how
they
are
attained
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
am
very
stupid
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
follow
you
for
example
how
did
you
deduce
that
this
man
was
intellectual
for
answer
holmes
clapped
the
hat
upon
his
head
it
came
right
over
the
forehead
and
settled
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
it
is
a
question
of
cubic
capacity
said
he
a
man
with
so
large
a
brain
must
have
something
in
it
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
then
this
hat
is
three
years
old
these
flat
brims
curled
at
the
edge
came
in
then
it
is
a
hat
of
the
very
best
quality
look
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
lining
if
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive
a
hat
three
years
ago
and
has
had
no
hat
since
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
world
well
that
is
clear
enough
certainly
but
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
retrogression
sherlock
holmes
laughed
here
is
the
foresight
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the
they
are
never
sold
upon
hats
if
this
man
ordered
one
it
is
a
sign
of
a
certain
amount
of
foresight
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the
wind
but
since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
formerly
which
is
a
distinct
proof
of
a
weakening
nature
on
the
other
hand
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
daubing
them
with
ink
which
is
a
sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
your
reasoning
is
certainly
plausible
the
further
points
that
he
is
that
his
hair
is
grizzled
that
it
has
been
recently
cut
and
that
he
uses
are
all
to
be
gathered
from
a
close
examination
of
the
lower
part
of
the
lining
the
lens
discloses
a
large
number
of
clean
cut
by
the
scissors
of
the
barber
they
all
appear
to
be
adhesive
and
there
is
a
distinct
odour
of
this
dust
you
will
observe
is
not
the
gritty
grey
dust
of
the
street
but
the
fluffy
brown
dust
of
the
house
showing
that
it
has
been
hung
up
indoors
most
of
the
time
while
the
marks
of
moisture
upon
the
inside
are
proof
positive
that
the
wearer
perspired
very
freely
and
could
therefore
hardly
be
in
the
best
of
training
but
his
wife
you
said
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
this
hat
has
not
been
brushed
for
weeks
when
i
see
you
my
dear
watson
with
a
week
accumulation
of
dust
upon
your
hat
and
when
your
wife
allows
you
to
go
out
in
such
a
state
i
shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
affection
but
he
might
be
a
bachelor
nay
he
was
bringing
home
the
goose
as
a
to
his
wife
remember
the
card
upon
the
bird
leg
you
have
an
answer
to
everything
but
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
house
one
tallow
stain
or
even
two
might
come
by
chance
but
when
i
see
no
less
than
five
i
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
tallow
walks
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
guttering
candle
in
the
other
anyhow
he
never
got
from
a
are
you
satisfied
well
it
is
very
ingenious
said
i
laughing
but
since
as
you
said
just
now
there
has
been
no
crime
committed
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of
a
goose
all
this
seems
to
be
rather
a
waste
of
energy
sherlock
holmes
had
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
when
the
door
flew
open
and
peterson
the
commissionaire
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
dazed
with
astonishment
the
goose
holmes
the
goose
sir
he
gasped
eh
what
of
it
then
has
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
window
holmes
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get
a
fairer
view
of
the
man
excited
face
see
here
sir
see
what
my
wife
found
in
its
crop
he
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm
a
brilliantly
scintillating
blue
stone
rather
smaller
than
a
bean
in
size
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
hand
sherlock
holmes
sat
up
with
a
whistle
by
jove
peterson
said
he
this
is
treasure
trove
indeed
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
got
a
diamond
sir
a
precious
stone
it
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
putty
it
more
than
a
precious
stone
it
is
the
precious
stone
not
the
countess
of
morcar
blue
carbuncle
i
ejaculated
precisely
so
i
ought
to
know
its
size
and
shape
seeing
that
i
have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
the
times
every
day
lately
it
is
absolutely
unique
and
its
value
can
only
be
conjectured
but
the
reward
offered
of
pounds
is
certainly
not
within
a
twentieth
part
of
the
market
price
a
thousand
pounds
great
lord
of
mercy
the
commissionaire
plumped
down
into
a
chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
that
is
the
reward
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
countess
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
gem
it
was
lost
if
i
remember
aright
at
the
hotel
cosmopolitan
i
remarked
precisely
so
on
december
just
five
days
ago
john
horner
a
plumber
was
accused
of
having
abstracted
it
from
the
the
evidence
against
him
was
so
strong
that
the
case
has
been
referred
to
the
assizes
i
have
some
account
of
the
matter
here
i
believe
he
rummaged
amid
his
newspapers
glancing
over
the
dates
until
at
last
he
smoothed
one
out
doubled
it
over
and
read
the
following
paragraph
hotel
cosmopolitan
jewel
robbery
john
horner
plumber
was
brought
up
upon
the
charge
of
having
upon
the
abstracted
from
the
of
the
countess
of
morcar
the
valuable
gem
known
as
the
blue
carbuncle
james
ryder
at
the
hotel
gave
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
shown
horner
up
to
the
of
the
countess
of
morcar
upon
the
day
of
the
robbery
in
order
that
he
might
solder
the
second
bar
of
the
grate
which
was
loose
he
had
remained
with
horner
some
little
time
but
had
finally
been
called
away
on
returning
he
found
that
horner
had
disappeared
that
the
bureau
had
been
forced
open
and
that
the
small
morocco
casket
in
which
as
it
afterwards
transpired
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
jewel
was
lying
empty
upon
the
ryder
instantly
gave
the
alarm
and
horner
was
arrested
the
same
evening
but
the
stone
could
not
be
found
either
upon
his
person
or
in
his
rooms
catherine
cusack
maid
to
the
countess
deposed
to
having
heard
ryder
cry
of
dismay
on
discovering
the
robbery
and
to
having
rushed
into
the
room
where
she
found
matters
as
described
by
the
last
witness
inspector
bradstreet
b
division
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
horner
who
struggled
frantically
and
protested
his
innocence
in
the
strongest
terms
evidence
of
a
previous
conviction
for
robbery
having
been
given
against
the
prisoner
the
magistrate
refused
to
deal
summarily
with
the
offence
but
referred
it
to
the
assizes
horner
who
had
shown
signs
of
intense
emotion
during
the
proceedings
fainted
away
at
the
conclusion
and
was
carried
out
of
court
hum
so
much
for
the
said
holmes
thoughtfully
tossing
aside
the
paper
the
question
for
us
now
to
solve
is
the
sequence
of
events
leading
from
a
rifled
at
one
end
to
the
crop
of
a
goose
in
tottenham
court
road
at
the
other
you
see
watson
our
little
deductions
have
suddenly
assumed
a
much
more
important
and
less
innocent
aspect
here
is
the
stone
the
stone
came
from
the
goose
and
the
goose
came
from
henry
baker
the
gentleman
with
the
bad
hat
and
all
the
other
characteristics
with
which
i
have
bored
you
so
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this
gentleman
and
ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
mystery
to
do
this
we
must
try
the
simplest
means
first
and
these
lie
undoubtedly
in
an
advertisement
in
all
the
evening
papers
if
this
fail
i
shall
have
recourse
to
other
methods
what
will
you
say
give
me
a
pencil
and
that
slip
of
paper
now
then
at
the
corner
of
goodge
street
a
goose
and
a
black
felt
hat
henry
baker
can
have
the
same
by
applying
at
this
evening
at
baker
street
that
is
clear
and
concise
very
but
will
he
see
it
well
he
is
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
papers
since
to
a
poor
man
the
loss
was
a
heavy
one
he
was
clearly
so
scared
by
his
mischance
in
breaking
the
window
and
by
the
approach
of
peterson
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
flight
but
since
then
he
must
have
bitterly
regretted
the
impulse
which
caused
him
to
drop
his
bird
then
again
the
introduction
of
his
name
will
cause
him
to
see
it
for
everyone
who
knows
him
will
direct
his
attention
to
it
here
you
are
peterson
run
down
to
the
advertising
agency
and
have
this
put
in
the
evening
papers
in
which
sir
oh
in
the
globe
star
pall
mall
james
evening
news
standard
echo
and
any
others
that
occur
to
you
very
well
sir
and
this
stone
ah
yes
i
shall
keep
the
stone
thank
you
and
i
say
peterson
just
buy
a
goose
on
your
way
back
and
leave
it
here
with
me
for
we
must
have
one
to
give
to
this
gentleman
in
place
of
the
one
which
your
family
is
now
devouring
when
the
commissionaire
had
gone
holmes
took
up
the
stone
and
held
it
against
the
light
it
a
bonny
thing
said
he
just
see
how
it
glints
and
sparkles
of
course
it
is
a
nucleus
and
focus
of
crime
every
good
stone
is
they
are
the
devil
pet
baits
in
the
larger
and
older
jewels
every
facet
may
stand
for
a
bloody
deed
this
stone
is
not
yet
twenty
years
old
it
was
found
in
the
banks
of
the
amoy
river
in
southern
china
and
is
remarkable
in
having
every
characteristic
of
the
carbuncle
save
that
it
is
blue
in
shade
instead
of
ruby
red
in
spite
of
its
youth
it
has
already
a
sinister
history
there
have
been
two
murders
a
a
suicide
and
several
robberies
brought
about
for
the
sake
of
this
weight
of
crystallised
charcoal
who
would
think
that
so
pretty
a
toy
would
be
a
purveyor
to
the
gallows
and
the
prison
i
lock
it
up
in
my
strong
box
now
and
drop
a
line
to
the
countess
to
say
that
we
have
it
do
you
think
that
this
man
horner
is
innocent
i
can
not
tell
well
then
do
you
imagine
that
this
other
one
henry
baker
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
it
is
i
think
much
more
likely
that
henry
baker
is
an
absolutely
innocent
man
who
had
no
idea
that
the
bird
which
he
was
carrying
was
of
considerably
more
value
than
if
it
were
made
of
solid
gold
that
however
i
shall
determine
by
a
very
simple
test
if
we
have
an
answer
to
our
advertisement
and
you
can
do
nothing
until
then
nothing
in
that
case
i
shall
continue
my
professional
round
but
i
shall
come
back
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
you
have
mentioned
for
i
should
like
to
see
the
solution
of
so
tangled
a
business
very
glad
to
see
you
i
dine
at
seven
there
is
a
woodcock
i
believe
by
the
way
in
view
of
recent
occurrences
perhaps
i
ought
to
ask
hudson
to
examine
its
crop
i
had
been
delayed
at
a
case
and
it
was
a
little
after
six
when
i
found
myself
in
baker
street
once
more
as
i
approached
the
house
i
saw
a
tall
man
in
a
scotch
bonnet
with
a
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
fanlight
just
as
i
arrived
the
door
was
opened
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
holmes
room
henry
baker
i
believe
said
he
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
assume
pray
take
this
chair
by
the
fire
baker
it
is
a
cold
night
and
i
observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
winter
ah
watson
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
time
is
that
your
hat
mr
baker
yes
sir
that
is
undoubtedly
my
hat
he
was
a
large
man
with
rounded
shoulders
a
massive
head
and
a
broad
intelligent
face
sloping
down
to
a
pointed
beard
of
grizzled
brown
a
touch
of
red
in
nose
and
cheeks
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
extended
hand
recalled
holmes
surmise
as
to
his
habits
his
rusty
black
was
buttoned
right
up
in
front
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without
a
sign
of
cuff
or
shirt
he
spoke
in
a
slow
staccato
fashion
choosing
his
words
with
care
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of
a
man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
had
at
the
hands
of
fortune
we
have
retained
these
things
for
some
days
said
holmes
because
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
address
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
advertise
our
visitor
gave
a
rather
shamefaced
laugh
shillings
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
were
he
remarked
i
had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
roughs
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
bird
i
did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in
a
hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
them
very
naturally
by
the
way
about
the
bird
we
were
compelled
to
eat
it
to
eat
it
our
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
excitement
yes
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
so
but
i
presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
sideboard
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
fresh
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
well
oh
certainly
certainly
answered
baker
with
a
sigh
of
relief
of
course
we
still
have
the
feathers
legs
crop
and
so
on
of
your
own
bird
so
if
you
wish
the
man
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
they
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
adventure
said
he
but
beyond
that
i
can
hardly
see
what
use
the
disjecta
membra
of
my
late
acquaintance
are
going
to
be
to
me
no
sir
i
think
that
with
your
permission
i
will
confine
my
attentions
to
the
excellent
bird
which
i
perceive
upon
the
sideboard
sherlock
holmes
glanced
sharply
across
at
me
with
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
there
is
your
hat
then
and
there
your
bird
said
he
by
the
way
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me
where
you
got
the
other
one
from
i
am
somewhat
of
a
fowl
fancier
and
i
have
seldom
seen
a
better
grown
goose
certainly
sir
said
baker
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his
arm
there
are
a
few
of
us
who
frequent
the
alpha
inn
near
the
museum
we
are
to
be
found
in
the
museum
itself
during
the
day
you
understand
this
year
our
good
host
windigate
by
name
instituted
a
goose
club
by
which
on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every
week
we
were
each
to
receive
a
bird
at
christmas
my
pence
were
duly
paid
and
the
rest
is
familiar
to
you
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
sir
for
a
scotch
bonnet
is
fitted
neither
to
my
years
nor
my
gravity
with
a
comical
pomposity
of
manner
he
bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
way
so
much
for
henry
baker
said
holmes
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
are
you
hungry
watson
not
particularly
then
i
suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into
a
supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
hot
by
all
means
it
was
a
bitter
night
so
we
drew
on
our
ulsters
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
throats
outside
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
breath
of
the
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
shots
our
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
doctors
quarter
wimpole
street
harley
street
and
so
through
wigmore
street
into
oxford
street
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
bloomsbury
at
the
alpha
inn
which
is
a
small
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
which
runs
down
into
holborn
holmes
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
landlord
your
beer
should
be
excellent
if
it
is
as
good
as
your
geese
said
he
my
geese
the
man
seemed
surprised
yes
i
was
speaking
only
half
an
hour
ago
to
henry
baker
who
was
a
member
of
your
goose
club
ah
yes
i
see
but
you
see
sir
them
not
our
geese
indeed
whose
then
well
i
got
the
two
dozen
from
a
salesman
in
covent
garden
indeed
i
know
some
of
them
which
was
it
breckinridge
is
his
name
ah
i
do
know
him
well
here
your
good
health
landlord
and
prosperity
to
your
house
now
for
breckinridge
he
continued
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
air
remember
watson
that
though
we
have
so
homely
a
thing
as
a
goose
at
one
end
of
this
chain
we
have
at
the
other
a
man
who
will
certainly
get
seven
years
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
innocence
it
is
possible
that
our
inquiry
may
but
confirm
his
guilt
but
in
any
case
we
have
a
line
of
investigation
which
has
been
missed
by
the
police
and
which
a
singular
chance
has
placed
in
our
hands
let
us
follow
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
faces
to
the
south
then
and
quick
march
we
passed
across
holborn
down
endell
street
and
so
through
a
zigzag
of
slums
to
covent
garden
market
one
of
the
largest
stalls
bore
the
name
of
breckinridge
upon
it
and
the
proprietor
a
man
with
a
sharp
face
and
trim
was
helping
a
boy
to
put
up
the
shutters
it
a
cold
night
said
holmes
the
salesman
nodded
and
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
my
companion
sold
out
of
geese
i
see
continued
holmes
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
marble
let
you
have
five
hundred
morning
that
no
good
well
there
are
some
on
the
stall
with
the
ah
but
i
was
recommended
to
you
who
by
the
landlord
of
the
alpha
oh
yes
i
sent
him
a
couple
of
dozen
fine
birds
they
were
too
now
where
did
you
get
them
from
to
my
surprise
the
question
provoked
a
burst
of
anger
from
the
salesman
now
then
mister
said
he
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
akimbo
what
are
you
driving
at
let
have
it
straight
now
it
is
straight
enough
i
should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
alpha
well
then
i
sha
tell
you
so
now
oh
it
is
a
matter
of
no
importance
but
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such
a
trifle
warm
you
be
as
warm
maybe
if
you
were
as
pestered
as
i
am
when
i
pay
good
money
for
a
good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
business
but
it
are
the
geese
and
did
you
sell
the
geese
to
and
will
you
take
for
the
geese
one
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
world
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
them
well
i
have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
inquiries
said
holmes
carelessly
if
you
wo
tell
us
the
bet
is
off
that
is
all
but
i
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on
a
matter
of
fowls
and
i
have
a
fiver
on
it
that
the
bird
i
ate
is
country
bred
well
then
you
lost
your
fiver
for
it
town
bred
snapped
the
salesman
it
nothing
of
the
kind
i
say
it
is
i
do
believe
it
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than
i
who
have
handled
them
ever
since
i
was
a
nipper
i
tell
you
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
alpha
were
town
bred
you
never
persuade
me
to
believe
that
will
you
bet
then
it
merely
taking
your
money
for
i
know
that
i
am
right
but
i
have
a
sovereign
on
with
you
just
to
teach
you
not
to
be
obstinate
the
salesman
chuckled
grimly
bring
me
the
books
bill
said
he
the
small
boy
brought
round
a
small
thin
volume
and
a
great
one
laying
them
out
together
beneath
the
hanging
lamp
now
then
cocksure
said
the
salesman
i
thought
that
i
was
out
of
geese
but
before
i
finish
you
find
that
there
is
still
one
left
in
my
shop
you
see
this
little
book
well
that
the
list
of
the
folk
from
whom
i
buy
see
well
then
here
on
this
page
are
the
country
folk
and
the
numbers
after
their
names
are
where
their
accounts
are
in
the
big
ledger
now
then
you
see
this
other
page
in
red
ink
well
that
is
a
list
of
my
town
suppliers
now
look
at
that
third
name
just
read
it
out
to
me
oakshott
brixton
road
read
holmes
quite
so
now
turn
that
up
in
the
ledger
holmes
turned
to
the
page
indicated
here
you
are
oakshott
brixton
road
egg
and
poultry
supplier
now
then
what
the
last
entry
geese
at
quite
so
there
you
are
and
underneath
to
windigate
of
the
alpha
at
what
have
you
to
say
now
sherlock
holmes
looked
deeply
chagrined
he
drew
a
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
slab
turning
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
words
a
few
yards
off
he
stopped
under
a
and
laughed
in
the
hearty
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
when
you
see
a
man
with
whiskers
of
that
cut
and
the
protruding
out
of
his
pocket
you
can
always
draw
him
by
a
bet
said
he
i
daresay
that
if
i
had
put
pounds
down
in
front
of
him
that
man
would
not
have
given
me
such
complete
information
as
was
drawn
from
him
by
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
me
on
a
wager
well
watson
we
are
i
fancy
nearing
the
end
of
our
quest
and
the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
oakshott
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
it
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
matter
and
i
should
his
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
left
turning
round
we
saw
a
little
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
lamp
while
breckinridge
the
salesman
framed
in
the
door
of
his
stall
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
figure
i
had
enough
of
you
and
your
geese
he
shouted
i
wish
you
were
all
at
the
devil
together
if
you
come
pestering
me
any
more
with
your
silly
talk
i
set
the
dog
at
you
you
bring
oakshott
here
and
i
answer
her
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
did
i
buy
the
geese
off
you
no
but
one
of
them
was
mine
all
the
same
whined
the
little
man
well
then
ask
oakshott
for
it
she
told
me
to
ask
you
well
you
can
ask
the
king
of
proosia
for
all
i
care
i
had
enough
of
it
get
out
of
this
he
rushed
fiercely
forward
and
the
inquirer
flitted
away
into
the
darkness
ha
this
may
save
us
a
visit
to
brixton
road
whispered
holmes
come
with
me
and
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
made
of
this
fellow
striding
through
the
scattered
knots
of
people
who
lounged
round
the
flaring
stalls
my
companion
speedily
overtook
the
little
man
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
he
sprang
round
and
i
could
see
in
the
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
been
driven
from
his
face
who
are
you
then
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
you
will
excuse
me
said
holmes
blandly
but
i
could
not
help
overhearing
the
questions
which
you
put
to
the
salesman
just
now
i
think
that
i
could
be
of
assistance
to
you
you
who
are
you
how
could
you
know
anything
of
the
matter
my
name
is
sherlock
holmes
it
is
my
business
to
know
what
other
people
do
know
but
you
can
know
nothing
of
this
excuse
me
i
know
everything
of
it
you
are
endeavouring
to
trace
some
geese
which
were
sold
by
oakshott
of
brixton
road
to
a
salesman
named
breckinridge
by
him
in
turn
to
windigate
of
the
alpha
and
by
him
to
his
club
of
which
henry
baker
is
a
member
oh
sir
you
are
the
very
man
whom
i
have
longed
to
meet
cried
the
little
fellow
with
outstretched
hands
and
quivering
fingers
i
can
hardly
explain
to
you
how
interested
i
am
in
this
matter
sherlock
holmes
hailed
a
which
was
passing
in
that
case
we
had
better
discuss
it
in
a
cosy
room
rather
than
in
this
said
he
but
pray
tell
me
before
we
go
farther
who
it
is
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
assisting
the
man
hesitated
for
an
instant
my
name
is
john
robinson
he
answered
with
a
sidelong
glance
no
no
the
real
name
said
holmes
sweetly
it
is
always
awkward
doing
business
with
an
alias
a
flush
sprang
to
the
white
cheeks
of
the
stranger
well
then
said
he
my
real
name
is
james
ryder
precisely
so
head
attendant
at
the
hotel
cosmopolitan
pray
step
into
the
cab
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
tell
you
everything
which
you
would
wish
to
know
the
little
man
stood
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
eyes
as
one
who
is
not
sure
whether
he
is
on
the
verge
of
a
windfall
or
of
a
catastrophe
then
he
stepped
into
the
cab
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
back
in
the
at
baker
street
nothing
had
been
said
during
our
drive
but
the
high
thin
breathing
of
our
new
companion
and
the
claspings
and
unclaspings
of
his
hands
spoke
of
the
nervous
tension
within
him
here
we
are
said
holmes
cheerily
as
we
filed
into
the
room
the
fire
looks
very
seasonable
in
this
weather
you
look
cold
ryder
pray
take
the
i
will
just
put
on
my
slippers
before
we
settle
this
little
matter
of
yours
now
then
you
want
to
know
what
became
of
those
geese
yes
sir
or
rather
i
fancy
of
that
goose
it
was
one
bird
i
imagine
in
which
you
were
interested
white
with
a
black
bar
across
the
tail
ryder
quivered
with
emotion
oh
sir
he
cried
can
you
tell
me
where
it
went
to
it
came
here
here
yes
and
a
most
remarkable
bird
it
proved
i
do
wonder
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
it
it
laid
an
egg
after
it
was
dead
the
bonniest
brightest
little
blue
egg
that
ever
was
seen
i
have
it
here
in
my
museum
our
visitor
staggered
to
his
feet
and
clutched
the
mantelpiece
with
his
right
hand
holmes
unlocked
his
and
held
up
the
blue
carbuncle
which
shone
out
like
a
star
with
a
cold
brilliant
radiance
ryder
stood
glaring
with
a
drawn
face
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown
it
the
game
up
ryder
said
holmes
quietly
hold
up
man
or
you
be
into
the
fire
give
him
an
arm
back
into
his
chair
watson
he
not
got
blood
enough
to
go
in
for
felony
with
impunity
give
him
a
dash
of
brandy
so
now
he
looks
a
little
more
human
what
a
shrimp
it
is
to
be
sure
for
a
moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
fallen
but
the
brandy
brought
a
tinge
of
colour
into
his
cheeks
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
accuser
i
have
almost
every
link
in
my
hands
and
all
the
proofs
which
i
could
possibly
need
so
there
is
little
which
you
need
tell
me
still
that
little
may
as
well
be
cleared
up
to
make
the
case
complete
you
had
heard
ryder
of
this
blue
stone
of
the
countess
of
morcar
it
was
catherine
cusack
who
told
me
of
it
said
he
in
a
crackling
voice
i
see
her
ladyship
well
the
temptation
of
sudden
wealth
so
easily
acquired
was
too
much
for
you
as
it
has
been
for
better
men
before
you
but
you
were
not
very
scrupulous
in
the
means
you
used
it
seems
to
me
ryder
that
there
is
the
making
of
a
very
pretty
villain
in
you
you
knew
that
this
man
horner
the
plumber
had
been
concerned
in
some
such
matter
before
and
that
suspicion
would
rest
the
more
readily
upon
him
what
did
you
do
then
you
made
some
small
job
in
my
room
you
and
your
confederate
cusack
and
you
managed
that
he
should
be
the
man
sent
for
then
when
he
had
left
you
rifled
the
raised
the
alarm
and
had
this
unfortunate
man
arrested
you
then
ryder
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the
rug
and
clutched
at
my
companion
knees
for
god
sake
have
mercy
he
shrieked
think
of
my
father
of
my
mother
it
would
break
their
hearts
i
never
went
wrong
before
i
never
will
again
i
swear
it
swear
it
on
a
bible
oh
do
bring
it
into
court
for
sake
do
get
back
into
your
chair
said
holmes
sternly
it
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
now
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
horner
in
the
dock
for
a
crime
of
which
he
knew
nothing
i
will
fly
holmes
i
will
leave
the
country
sir
then
the
charge
against
him
will
break
down
hum
we
will
talk
about
that
and
now
let
us
hear
a
true
account
of
the
next
act
how
came
the
stone
into
the
goose
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
market
tell
us
the
truth
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
safety
ryder
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
lips
i
will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
happened
sir
said
he
when
horner
had
been
arrested
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
once
for
i
did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
room
there
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
safe
i
went
out
as
if
on
some
commission
and
i
made
for
my
house
she
had
married
a
man
named
oakshott
and
lived
in
brixton
road
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
market
all
the
way
there
every
man
i
met
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
policeman
or
a
detective
and
for
all
that
it
was
a
cold
night
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before
i
came
to
the
brixton
road
my
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
why
i
was
so
pale
but
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
hotel
then
i
went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
i
had
a
friend
once
called
maudsley
who
went
to
the
bad
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
pentonville
one
day
he
had
met
me
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
thieves
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
stole
i
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
for
i
knew
one
or
two
things
about
him
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
kilburn
where
he
lived
and
take
him
into
my
confidence
he
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
money
but
how
to
get
to
him
in
safety
i
thought
of
the
agonies
i
had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
hotel
i
might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
searched
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
feet
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how
i
could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
lived
my
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that
i
might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for
a
christmas
present
and
i
knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
word
i
would
take
my
goose
now
and
in
it
i
would
carry
my
stone
to
kilburn
there
was
a
little
shed
in
the
yard
and
behind
this
i
drove
one
of
the
birds
a
fine
big
one
white
with
a
barred
tail
i
caught
it
and
prying
its
bill
open
i
thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
reach
the
bird
gave
a
gulp
and
i
felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
crop
but
the
creature
flapped
and
struggled
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
matter
as
i
turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
others
were
you
doing
with
that
bird
jem
says
she
said
i
said
you
give
me
one
for
christmas
and
i
was
feeling
which
was
the
fattest
says
she
set
yours
aside
for
you
jem
bird
we
call
it
it
the
big
white
one
over
yonder
there
of
them
which
makes
one
for
you
and
one
for
us
and
two
dozen
for
the
market
you
maggie
says
i
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
i
rather
have
that
one
i
was
handling
just
now
other
is
a
good
three
pound
heavier
said
she
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
you
mind
i
have
the
other
and
i
take
it
now
said
i
just
as
you
like
said
she
a
little
huffed
is
it
you
want
then
white
one
with
the
barred
tail
right
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
very
well
kill
it
and
take
it
with
you
well
i
did
what
she
said
holmes
and
i
carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
kilburn
i
told
my
pal
what
i
had
done
for
he
was
a
man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell
a
thing
like
that
to
he
laughed
until
he
choked
and
we
got
a
knife
and
opened
the
goose
my
heart
turned
to
water
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
stone
and
i
knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
occurred
i
left
the
bird
rushed
back
to
my
sister
and
hurried
into
the
back
yard
there
was
not
a
bird
to
be
seen
there
are
they
all
maggie
i
cried
to
the
dealer
jem
dealer
of
covent
garden
was
there
another
with
a
barred
tail
i
asked
same
as
the
one
i
chose
jem
there
were
two
ones
and
i
could
never
tell
them
apart
well
then
of
course
i
saw
it
all
and
i
ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
breckinridge
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
once
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
gone
you
heard
him
yourselves
well
he
has
always
answered
me
like
that
my
sister
thinks
that
i
am
going
mad
sometimes
i
think
that
i
am
myself
and
now
and
now
i
am
myself
a
branded
thief
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which
i
sold
my
character
god
help
me
god
help
me
he
burst
into
convulsive
sobbing
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
sherlock
holmes
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
then
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
door
get
out
said
he
what
sir
oh
heaven
bless
you
no
more
words
get
out
and
no
more
words
were
needed
there
was
a
rush
a
clatter
upon
the
stairs
the
bang
of
a
door
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
street
after
all
watson
said
holmes
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
pipe
i
am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
deficiencies
if
horner
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
thing
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
him
and
the
case
must
collapse
i
suppose
that
i
am
commuting
a
felony
but
it
is
just
possible
that
i
am
saving
a
soul
this
fellow
will
not
go
wrong
again
he
is
too
terribly
frightened
send
him
to
gaol
now
and
you
make
him
a
for
life
besides
it
is
the
season
of
forgiveness
chance
has
put
in
our
way
a
most
singular
and
whimsical
problem
and
its
solution
is
its
own
reward
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
bell
doctor
we
will
begin
another
investigation
in
which
also
a
bird
will
be
the
chief
feature
viii
the
adventure
of
the
speckled
band
on
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which
i
have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
i
find
many
tragic
some
comic
a
large
number
merely
strange
but
none
commonplace
for
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
wealth
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
unusual
and
even
the
fantastic
of
all
these
varied
cases
however
i
can
not
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
surrey
family
of
the
roylotts
of
stoke
moran
the
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
holmes
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
baker
street
it
is
possible
that
i
might
have
placed
them
upon
record
before
but
a
promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
time
from
which
i
have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
given
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
light
for
i
have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
grimesby
roylott
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
truth
it
was
early
in
april
in
the
year
that
i
woke
one
morning
to
find
sherlock
holmes
standing
fully
dressed
by
the
side
of
my
bed
he
was
a
late
riser
as
a
rule
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only
a
seven
i
blinked
up
at
him
in
some
surprise
and
perhaps
just
a
little
resentment
for
i
was
myself
regular
in
my
habits
very
sorry
to
knock
you
up
watson
said
he
but
it
the
common
lot
this
morning
hudson
has
been
knocked
up
she
retorted
upon
me
and
i
on
you
what
is
it
then
a
fire
no
a
client
it
seems
that
a
young
lady
has
arrived
in
a
considerable
state
of
excitement
who
insists
upon
seeing
me
she
is
waiting
now
in
the
now
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
beds
i
presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
communicate
should
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
case
you
would
i
am
sure
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
outset
i
thought
at
any
rate
that
i
should
call
you
and
give
you
the
chance
my
dear
fellow
i
would
not
miss
it
for
anything
i
had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
holmes
in
his
professional
investigations
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
deductions
as
swift
as
intuitions
and
yet
always
founded
on
a
logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
him
i
rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in
a
few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
a
lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
rose
as
we
entered
madam
said
holmes
cheerily
my
name
is
sherlock
holmes
this
is
my
intimate
friend
and
associate
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
ha
i
am
glad
to
see
that
hudson
has
had
the
good
sense
to
light
the
fire
pray
draw
up
to
it
and
i
shall
order
you
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
for
i
observe
that
you
are
shivering
it
is
not
cold
which
makes
me
shiver
said
the
woman
in
a
low
voice
changing
her
seat
as
requested
what
then
it
is
fear
holmes
it
is
terror
she
raised
her
veil
as
she
spoke
and
we
could
see
that
she
was
indeed
in
a
pitiable
state
of
agitation
her
face
all
drawn
and
grey
with
restless
frightened
eyes
like
those
of
some
hunted
animal
her
features
and
figure
were
those
of
a
woman
of
thirty
but
her
hair
was
shot
with
premature
grey
and
her
expression
was
weary
and
haggard
sherlock
holmes
ran
her
over
with
one
of
his
quick
glances
you
must
not
fear
said
he
soothingly
bending
forward
and
patting
her
forearm
we
shall
soon
set
matters
right
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
come
in
by
train
this
morning
i
see
you
know
me
then
no
but
i
observe
the
second
half
of
a
return
ticket
in
the
palm
of
your
left
glove
you
must
have
started
early
and
yet
you
had
a
good
drive
in
a
along
heavy
roads
before
you
reached
the
station
the
lady
gave
a
violent
start
and
stared
in
bewilderment
at
my
companion
there
is
no
mystery
my
dear
madam
said
he
smiling
the
left
arm
of
your
jacket
is
spattered
with
mud
in
no
less
than
seven
places
the
marks
are
perfectly
fresh
there
is
no
vehicle
save
a
which
throws
up
mud
in
that
way
and
then
only
when
you
sit
on
the
side
of
the
driver
whatever
your
reasons
may
be
you
are
perfectly
correct
said
she
i
started
from
home
before
six
reached
leatherhead
at
twenty
past
and
came
in
by
the
first
train
to
waterloo
sir
i
can
stand
this
strain
no
longer
i
shall
go
mad
if
it
continues
i
have
no
one
to
turn
to
none
save
only
one
who
cares
for
me
and
he
poor
fellow
can
be
of
little
aid
i
have
heard
of
you
holmes
i
have
heard
of
you
from
farintosh
whom
you
helped
in
the
hour
of
her
sore
need
it
was
from
her
that
i
had
your
address
oh
sir
do
you
not
think
that
you
could
help
me
too
and
at
least
throw
a
little
light
through
the
dense
darkness
which
surrounds
me
at
present
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
reward
you
for
your
services
but
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
i
shall
be
married
with
the
control
of
my
own
income
and
then
at
least
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
holmes
turned
to
his
desk
and
unlocking
it
drew
out
a
small
which
he
consulted
farintosh
said
he
ah
yes
i
recall
the
case
it
was
concerned
with
an
opal
tiara
i
think
it
was
before
your
time
watson
i
can
only
say
madam
that
i
shall
be
happy
to
devote
the
same
care
to
your
case
as
i
did
to
that
of
your
friend
as
to
reward
my
profession
is
its
own
reward
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
defray
whatever
expenses
i
may
be
put
to
at
the
time
which
suits
you
best
and
now
i
beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
matter
alas
replied
our
visitor
the
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
vague
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
points
which
might
seem
trivial
to
another
that
even
he
to
whom
of
all
others
i
have
a
right
to
look
for
help
and
advice
looks
upon
all
that
i
tell
him
about
it
as
the
fancies
of
a
nervous
woman
he
does
not
say
so
but
i
can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers
and
averted
eyes
but
i
have
heard
holmes
that
you
can
see
deeply
into
the
manifold
wickedness
of
the
human
heart
you
may
advise
me
how
to
walk
amid
the
dangers
which
encompass
me
i
am
all
attention
madam
my
name
is
helen
stoner
and
i
am
living
with
my
stepfather
who
is
the
last
survivor
of
one
of
the
oldest
saxon
families
in
england
the
roylotts
of
stoke
moran
on
the
western
border
of
surrey
holmes
nodded
his
head
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
said
he
the
family
was
at
one
time
among
the
richest
in
england
and
the
estates
extended
over
the
borders
into
berkshire
in
the
north
and
hampshire
in
the
west
in
the
last
century
however
four
successive
heirs
were
of
a
dissolute
and
wasteful
disposition
and
the
family
ruin
was
eventually
completed
by
a
gambler
in
the
days
of
the
regency
nothing
was
left
save
a
few
acres
of
ground
and
the
house
which
is
itself
crushed
under
a
heavy
mortgage
the
last
squire
dragged
out
his
existence
there
living
the
horrible
life
of
an
aristocratic
pauper
but
his
only
son
my
stepfather
seeing
that
he
must
adapt
himself
to
the
new
conditions
obtained
an
advance
from
a
relative
which
enabled
him
to
take
a
medical
degree
and
went
out
to
calcutta
where
by
his
professional
skill
and
his
force
of
character
he
established
a
large
practice
in
a
fit
of
anger
however
caused
by
some
robberies
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
house
he
beat
his
native
butler
to
death
and
narrowly
escaped
a
capital
sentence
as
it
was
he
suffered
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
and
afterwards
returned
to
england
a
morose
and
disappointed
man
when
roylott
was
in
india
he
married
my
mother
stoner
the
young
widow
of
stoner
of
the
bengal
artillery
my
sister
julia
and
i
were
twins
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother
she
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
not
less
than
pounds
a
year
and
this
she
bequeathed
to
roylott
entirely
while
we
resided
with
him
with
a
provision
that
a
certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
marriage
shortly
after
our
return
to
england
my
mother
died
she
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in
a
railway
accident
near
crewe
roylott
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
london
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
stoke
moran
the
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
wants
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
happiness
but
a
terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
time
instead
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
neighbours
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see
a
roylott
of
stoke
moran
back
in
the
old
family
seat
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
path
violence
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
family
and
in
my
stepfather
case
it
had
i
believe
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
tropics
a
series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
place
two
of
which
ended
in
the
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
village
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
approach
for
he
is
a
man
of
immense
strength
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
anger
last
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over
a
parapet
into
a
stream
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which
i
could
gather
together
that
i
was
able
to
avert
another
public
exposure
he
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
gipsies
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
land
which
represent
the
family
estate
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
tents
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
end
he
has
a
passion
also
for
indian
animals
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by
a
correspondent
and
he
has
at
this
moment
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
master
you
can
imagine
from
what
i
say
that
my
poor
sister
julia
and
i
had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
lives
no
servant
would
stay
with
us
and
for
a
long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
house
she
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
whiten
even
as
mine
has
your
sister
is
dead
then
she
died
just
two
years
ago
and
it
is
of
her
death
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
you
can
understand
that
living
the
life
which
i
have
described
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
position
we
had
however
an
aunt
my
mother
maiden
sister
miss
honoria
westphail
who
lives
near
harrow
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
house
julia
went
there
at
christmas
two
years
ago
and
met
there
a
major
of
marines
to
whom
she
became
engaged
my
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
marriage
but
within
a
fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
wedding
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
companion
sherlock
holmes
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in
a
cushion
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
visitor
pray
be
precise
as
to
details
said
he
it
is
easy
for
me
to
be
so
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
memory
the
is
as
i
have
already
said
very
old
and
only
one
wing
is
now
inhabited
the
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
floor
the
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
buildings
of
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
roylott
the
second
my
sister
and
the
third
my
own
there
is
no
communication
between
them
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
corridor
do
i
make
myself
plain
perfectly
so
the
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
lawn
that
fatal
night
roylott
had
gone
to
his
room
early
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
indian
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
smoke
she
left
her
room
therefore
and
came
into
mine
where
she
sat
for
some
time
chatting
about
her
approaching
wedding
at
eleven
she
rose
to
leave
me
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
me
helen
said
she
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
night
said
i
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
whistle
yourself
in
your
sleep
not
but
why
during
the
last
few
nights
i
have
always
about
three
in
the
morning
heard
a
low
clear
whistle
i
am
a
light
sleeper
and
it
has
awakened
me
i
can
not
tell
where
it
came
from
perhaps
from
the
next
room
perhaps
from
the
lawn
i
thought
that
i
would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
it
i
have
not
it
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
plantation
likely
and
yet
if
it
were
on
the
lawn
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
also
but
i
sleep
more
heavily
than
you
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
at
any
rate
she
smiled
back
at
me
closed
my
door
and
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
her
key
turn
in
the
lock
indeed
said
holmes
was
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
night
always
and
why
i
think
that
i
mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
we
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
locked
quite
so
pray
proceed
with
your
statement
i
could
not
sleep
that
night
a
vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
me
my
sister
and
i
you
will
recollect
were
twins
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied
it
was
a
wild
night
the
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
windows
suddenly
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
gale
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of
a
terrified
woman
i
knew
that
it
was
my
sister
voice
i
sprang
from
my
bed
wrapped
a
shawl
round
me
and
rushed
into
the
corridor
as
i
opened
my
door
i
seemed
to
hear
a
low
whistle
such
as
my
sister
described
and
a
few
moments
later
a
clanging
sound
as
if
a
mass
of
metal
had
fallen
as
i
ran
down
the
passage
my
sister
door
was
unlocked
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
hinges
i
stared
at
it
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
it
by
the
light
of
the
i
saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
opening
her
face
blanched
with
terror
her
hands
groping
for
help
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of
a
drunkard
i
ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
her
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
she
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
pain
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
convulsed
at
first
i
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
me
but
as
i
bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
a
voice
which
i
shall
never
forget
my
god
helen
it
was
the
band
the
speckled
band
there
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
said
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor
room
but
a
fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
words
i
rushed
out
calling
loudly
for
my
stepfather
and
i
met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
when
he
reached
my
sister
side
she
was
unconscious
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
village
all
efforts
were
in
vain
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
consciousness
such
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
sister
one
moment
said
holmes
are
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
sound
could
you
swear
to
it
that
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
inquiry
it
is
my
strong
impression
that
i
heard
it
and
yet
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
house
i
may
possibly
have
been
deceived
was
your
sister
dressed
no
she
was
in
her
in
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of
a
match
and
in
her
left
a
showing
that
she
had
struck
a
light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
place
that
is
important
and
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
to
he
investigated
the
case
with
great
care
for
conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
county
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
death
my
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
side
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
shutters
with
broad
iron
bars
which
were
secured
every
night
the
walls
were
carefully
sounded
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
round
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
examined
with
the
same
result
the
chimney
is
wide
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
staples
it
is
certain
therefore
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
end
besides
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
her
how
about
poison
the
doctors
examined
her
for
it
but
without
success
what
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
of
then
it
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
shock
though
what
it
was
that
frightened
her
i
can
not
imagine
were
there
gipsies
in
the
plantation
at
the
time
yes
there
are
nearly
always
some
there
ah
and
what
did
you
gather
from
this
allusion
to
a
band
a
speckled
band
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
it
was
merely
the
wild
talk
of
delirium
sometimes
that
it
may
have
referred
to
some
band
of
people
perhaps
to
these
very
gipsies
in
the
plantation
i
do
not
know
whether
the
spotted
handkerchiefs
which
so
many
of
them
wear
over
their
heads
might
have
suggested
the
strange
adjective
which
she
used
holmes
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
is
far
from
being
satisfied
these
are
very
deep
waters
said
he
pray
go
on
with
your
narrative
two
years
have
passed
since
then
and
my
life
has
been
until
lately
lonelier
than
ever
a
month
ago
however
a
dear
friend
whom
i
have
known
for
many
years
has
done
me
the
honour
to
ask
my
hand
in
marriage
his
name
is
armitage
percy
armitage
the
second
son
of
armitage
of
crane
water
near
reading
my
stepfather
has
offered
no
opposition
to
the
match
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
the
spring
two
days
ago
some
repairs
were
started
in
the
west
wing
of
the
building
and
my
bedroom
wall
has
been
pierced
so
that
i
have
had
to
move
into
the
chamber
in
which
my
sister
died
and
to
sleep
in
the
very
bed
in
which
she
slept
imagine
then
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
night
as
i
lay
awake
thinking
over
her
terrible
fate
i
suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
the
herald
of
her
own
death
i
sprang
up
and
lit
the
lamp
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room
i
was
too
shaken
to
go
to
bed
again
however
so
i
dressed
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
i
slipped
down
got
a
at
the
crown
inn
which
is
opposite
and
drove
to
leatherhead
from
whence
i
have
come
on
this
morning
with
the
one
object
of
seeing
you
and
asking
your
advice
you
have
done
wisely
said
my
friend
but
have
you
told
me
all
yes
all
miss
roylott
you
have
not
you
are
screening
your
stepfather
why
what
do
you
mean
for
answer
holmes
pushed
back
the
frill
of
black
lace
which
fringed
the
hand
that
lay
upon
our
visitor
knee
five
little
livid
spots
the
marks
of
four
fingers
and
a
thumb
were
printed
upon
the
white
wrist
you
have
been
cruelly
used
said
holmes
the
lady
coloured
deeply
and
covered
over
her
injured
wrist
he
is
a
hard
man
she
said
and
perhaps
he
hardly
knows
his
own
strength
there
was
a
long
silence
during
which
holmes
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
fire
this
is
a
very
deep
business
he
said
at
last
there
are
a
thousand
details
which
i
should
desire
to
know
before
i
decide
upon
our
course
of
action
yet
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
we
were
to
come
to
stoke
moran
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
see
over
these
rooms
without
the
knowledge
of
your
stepfather
as
it
happens
he
spoke
of
coming
into
town
upon
some
most
important
business
it
is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all
day
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
you
we
have
a
housekeeper
now
but
she
is
old
and
foolish
and
i
could
easily
get
her
out
of
the
way
excellent
you
are
not
averse
to
this
trip
watson
by
no
means
then
we
shall
both
come
what
are
you
going
to
do
yourself
i
have
one
or
two
things
which
i
would
wish
to
do
now
that
i
am
in
town
but
i
shall
return
by
the
twelve
train
so
as
to
be
there
in
time
for
your
coming
and
you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
afternoon
i
have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
to
will
you
not
wait
and
breakfast
no
i
must
go
my
heart
is
lightened
already
since
i
have
confided
my
trouble
to
you
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
afternoon
she
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face
and
glided
from
the
room
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
watson
asked
sherlock
holmes
leaning
back
in
his
chair
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
dark
and
sinister
business
dark
enough
and
sinister
enough
yet
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
sound
and
that
the
door
window
and
chimney
are
impassable
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
end
what
becomes
then
of
these
nocturnal
whistles
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
woman
i
can
not
think
when
you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
night
the
presence
of
a
band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
doctor
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
stepdaughter
marriage
the
dying
allusion
to
a
band
and
finally
the
fact
that
miss
helen
stoner
heard
a
metallic
clang
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
place
i
think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
lines
but
what
then
did
the
gipsies
do
i
can
not
imagine
i
see
many
objections
to
any
such
theory
and
so
do
i
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
stoke
moran
this
day
i
want
to
see
whether
the
objections
are
fatal
or
if
they
may
be
explained
away
but
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil
the
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
open
and
that
a
huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
aperture
his
costume
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of
the
agricultural
having
a
black
a
long
and
a
pair
of
high
gaiters
with
a
swinging
in
his
hand
so
tall
was
he
that
his
hat
actually
brushed
the
cross
bar
of
the
doorway
and
his
breadth
seemed
to
span
it
across
from
side
to
side
a
large
face
seared
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
burned
yellow
with
the
sun
and
marked
with
every
evil
passion
was
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
while
his
eyes
and
his
high
thin
fleshless
nose
gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to
a
fierce
old
bird
of
prey
which
of
you
is
holmes
asked
this
apparition
my
name
sir
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
said
my
companion
quietly
i
am
grimesby
roylott
of
stoke
moran
indeed
doctor
said
holmes
blandly
pray
take
a
seat
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
stepdaughter
has
been
here
i
have
traced
her
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
it
is
a
little
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year
said
holmes
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
screamed
the
old
man
furiously
but
i
have
heard
that
the
crocuses
promise
well
continued
my
companion
imperturbably
ha
you
put
me
off
do
you
said
our
new
visitor
taking
a
step
forward
and
shaking
his
i
know
you
you
scoundrel
i
have
heard
of
you
before
you
are
holmes
the
meddler
my
friend
smiled
holmes
the
busybody
his
smile
broadened
holmes
the
scotland
yard
holmes
chuckled
heartily
your
conversation
is
most
entertaining
said
he
when
you
go
out
close
the
door
for
there
is
a
decided
draught
i
will
go
when
i
have
said
my
say
do
you
dare
to
meddle
with
my
affairs
i
know
that
miss
stoner
has
been
here
i
traced
her
i
am
a
dangerous
man
to
fall
foul
of
see
here
he
stepped
swiftly
forward
seized
the
poker
and
bent
it
into
a
curve
with
his
huge
brown
hands
see
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of
my
grip
he
snarled
and
hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out
of
the
room
he
seems
a
very
amiable
person
said
holmes
laughing
i
am
not
quite
so
bulky
but
if
he
had
remained
i
might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
own
as
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
and
with
a
sudden
effort
straightened
it
out
again
fancy
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official
detective
force
this
incident
gives
zest
to
our
investigation
however
and
i
only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
her
and
now
watson
we
shall
order
breakfast
and
afterwards
i
shall
walk
down
to
doctors
commons
where
i
hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us
in
this
matter
it
was
nearly
one
when
sherlock
holmes
returned
from
his
excursion
he
held
in
his
hand
a
sheet
of
blue
paper
scrawled
over
with
notes
and
figures
i
have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
wife
said
he
to
determine
its
exact
meaning
i
have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the
present
prices
of
the
investments
with
which
it
is
concerned
the
total
income
which
at
the
time
of
the
wife
death
was
little
short
of
pounds
is
now
through
the
fall
in
agricultural
prices
not
more
than
pounds
each
daughter
can
claim
an
income
of
pounds
in
case
of
marriage
it
is
evident
therefore
that
if
both
girls
had
married
this
beauty
would
have
had
a
mere
pittance
while
even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to
a
very
serious
extent
my
morning
work
has
not
been
wasted
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
sort
and
now
watson
this
is
too
serious
for
dawdling
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
affairs
so
if
you
are
ready
we
shall
call
a
cab
and
drive
to
waterloo
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
slip
your
revolver
into
your
pocket
an
eley
no
is
an
excellent
argument
with
gentlemen
who
can
twist
steel
pokers
into
knots
that
and
a
are
i
think
all
that
we
need
at
waterloo
we
were
fortunate
in
catching
a
train
for
leatherhead
where
we
hired
a
trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
surrey
lanes
it
was
a
perfect
day
with
a
bright
sun
and
a
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens
the
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
shoots
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
earth
to
me
at
least
there
was
a
strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
engaged
my
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
trap
his
arms
folded
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
buried
in
the
deepest
thought
suddenly
however
he
started
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
over
the
meadows
look
there
said
he
a
heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in
a
gentle
slope
thickening
into
a
grove
at
the
highest
point
from
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
of
a
very
old
mansion
stoke
moran
said
he
yes
sir
that
be
the
house
of
grimesby
roylott
remarked
the
driver
there
is
some
building
going
on
there
said
holmes
that
is
where
we
are
going
there
the
village
said
the
driver
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
left
but
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
house
you
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
stile
and
so
by
the
over
the
fields
there
it
is
where
the
lady
is
walking
and
the
lady
i
fancy
is
miss
stoner
observed
holmes
shading
his
eyes
yes
i
think
we
had
better
do
as
you
suggest
we
got
off
paid
our
fare
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
leatherhead
i
thought
it
as
well
said
holmes
as
we
climbed
the
stile
that
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
architects
or
on
some
definite
business
it
may
stop
his
gossip
miss
stoner
you
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
word
our
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with
a
face
which
spoke
her
joy
i
have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
you
she
cried
shaking
hands
with
us
warmly
all
has
turned
out
splendidly
roylott
has
gone
to
town
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
evening
we
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor
acquaintance
said
holmes
and
in
a
few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
occurred
miss
stoner
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
listened
good
heavens
she
cried
he
has
followed
me
then
so
it
appears
he
is
so
cunning
that
i
never
know
when
i
am
safe
from
him
what
will
he
say
when
he
returns
he
must
guard
himself
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
track
you
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
if
he
is
violent
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt
at
harrow
now
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
examine
the
building
was
of
grey
stone
with
a
high
central
portion
and
two
curving
wings
like
the
claws
of
a
crab
thrown
out
on
each
side
in
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
boards
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
in
a
picture
of
ruin
the
central
portion
was
in
little
better
repair
but
the
block
was
comparatively
modern
and
the
blinds
in
the
windows
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimneys
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
resided
some
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
wall
and
the
had
been
broken
into
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
visit
holmes
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
outsides
of
the
windows
this
i
take
it
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep
the
centre
one
to
your
sister
and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
roylott
chamber
exactly
so
but
i
am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
one
pending
the
alterations
as
i
understand
by
the
way
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
wall
there
were
none
i
believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
room
ah
that
is
suggestive
now
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
open
there
are
windows
in
it
of
course
yes
but
very
small
ones
too
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
through
as
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
night
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
side
now
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
shutters
miss
stoner
did
so
and
holmes
after
a
careful
examination
through
the
open
window
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
open
but
without
success
there
was
no
slit
through
which
a
knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
bar
then
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
hinges
but
they
were
of
solid
iron
built
firmly
into
the
massive
masonry
hum
said
he
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
my
theory
certainly
presents
some
difficulties
no
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
bolted
well
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
matter
a
small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
opened
holmes
refused
to
examine
the
third
chamber
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
second
that
in
which
miss
stoner
was
now
sleeping
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
fate
it
was
a
homely
little
room
with
a
low
ceiling
and
a
gaping
fireplace
after
the
fashion
of
old
a
brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
corner
a
narrow
bed
in
another
and
a
on
the
side
of
the
window
these
articles
with
two
small
chairs
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for
a
square
of
wilton
carpet
in
the
centre
the
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
brown
oak
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
house
holmes
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into
a
corner
and
sat
silent
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
down
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
apartment
where
does
that
bell
communicate
with
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to
a
thick
which
hung
down
beside
the
bed
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
pillow
it
goes
to
the
housekeeper
room
it
looks
newer
than
the
other
things
yes
it
was
only
put
there
a
couple
of
years
ago
your
sister
asked
for
it
i
suppose
no
i
never
heard
of
her
using
it
we
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
ourselves
indeed
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice
a
there
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
satisfy
myself
as
to
this
floor
he
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
forward
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
boards
then
he
did
the
same
with
the
with
which
the
chamber
was
panelled
finally
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
wall
finally
he
took
the
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
brisk
tug
why
it
a
dummy
said
he
wo
it
ring
no
it
is
not
even
attached
to
a
wire
this
is
very
interesting
you
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to
a
hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
is
how
very
absurd
i
never
noticed
that
before
very
strange
muttered
holmes
pulling
at
the
rope
there
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
room
for
example
what
a
fool
a
builder
must
be
to
open
a
ventilator
into
another
room
when
with
the
same
trouble
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
air
that
is
also
quite
modern
said
the
lady
done
about
the
same
time
as
the
remarked
holmes
yes
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
time
they
seem
to
have
been
of
a
most
interesting
character
dummy
and
ventilators
which
do
not
ventilate
with
your
permission
miss
stoner
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
apartment
grimesby
roylott
chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
but
was
as
plainly
furnished
a
a
small
wooden
shelf
full
of
books
mostly
of
a
technical
character
an
armchair
beside
the
bed
a
plain
wooden
chair
against
the
wall
a
round
table
and
a
large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
eye
holmes
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
interest
what
in
here
he
asked
tapping
the
safe
my
stepfather
business
papers
oh
you
have
seen
inside
then
only
once
some
years
ago
i
remember
that
it
was
full
of
papers
there
is
a
cat
in
it
for
example
no
what
a
strange
idea
well
look
at
this
he
took
up
a
small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
it
no
we
do
keep
a
cat
but
there
is
a
cheetah
and
a
baboon
ah
yes
of
course
well
a
cheetah
is
just
a
big
cat
and
yet
a
saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
wants
i
daresay
there
is
one
point
which
i
should
wish
to
determine
he
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
attention
thank
you
that
is
quite
settled
said
he
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
pocket
hullo
here
is
something
interesting
the
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was
a
small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
bed
the
lash
however
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make
a
loop
of
whipcord
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
it
a
common
enough
lash
but
i
do
know
why
it
should
be
tied
that
is
not
quite
so
common
is
it
ah
me
it
a
wicked
world
and
when
a
clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
all
i
think
that
i
have
seen
enough
now
miss
stoner
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
lawn
i
had
never
seen
my
friend
face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
investigation
we
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
lawn
neither
miss
stoner
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
it
is
very
essential
miss
stoner
said
he
that
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
respect
i
shall
most
certainly
do
so
the
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
hesitation
your
life
may
depend
upon
your
compliance
i
assure
you
that
i
am
in
your
hands
in
the
first
place
both
my
friend
and
i
must
spend
the
night
in
your
room
both
miss
stoner
and
i
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
yes
it
must
be
so
let
me
explain
i
believe
that
that
is
the
village
inn
over
there
yes
that
is
the
crown
very
good
your
windows
would
be
visible
from
there
certainly
you
must
confine
yourself
to
your
room
on
pretence
of
a
headache
when
your
stepfather
comes
back
then
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
night
you
must
open
the
shutters
of
your
window
undo
the
hasp
put
your
lamp
there
as
a
signal
to
us
and
then
withdraw
quietly
with
everything
which
you
are
likely
to
want
into
the
room
which
you
used
to
occupy
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
the
repairs
you
could
manage
there
for
one
night
oh
yes
easily
the
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
hands
but
what
will
you
do
we
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
room
and
we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
you
i
believe
holmes
that
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind
said
miss
stoner
laying
her
hand
upon
my
companion
sleeve
perhaps
i
have
then
for
pity
sake
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
death
i
should
prefer
to
have
clearer
proofs
before
i
speak
you
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
correct
and
if
she
died
from
some
sudden
fright
no
i
do
not
think
so
i
think
that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible
cause
and
now
miss
stoner
we
must
leave
you
for
if
roylott
returned
and
saw
us
our
journey
would
be
in
vain
and
be
brave
for
if
you
will
do
what
i
have
told
you
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
soon
drive
away
the
dangers
that
threaten
you
sherlock
holmes
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
a
bedroom
and
at
the
crown
inn
they
were
on
the
upper
floor
and
from
our
window
we
could
command
a
view
of
the
avenue
gate
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
stoke
moran
manor
house
at
dusk
we
saw
grimesby
roylott
drive
past
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
him
the
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
gates
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor
voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
him
the
trap
drove
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
saw
a
sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
do
you
know
watson
said
holmes
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
darkness
i
have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
there
is
a
distinct
element
of
danger
can
i
be
of
assistance
your
presence
might
be
invaluable
then
i
shall
certainly
come
it
is
very
kind
of
you
you
speak
of
danger
you
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
me
no
but
i
fancy
that
i
may
have
deduced
a
little
more
i
imagine
that
you
saw
all
that
i
did
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer
i
confess
is
more
than
i
can
imagine
you
saw
the
ventilator
too
yes
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
a
very
unusual
thing
to
have
a
small
opening
between
two
rooms
it
was
so
small
that
a
rat
could
hardly
pass
through
i
knew
that
we
should
find
a
ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
stoke
moran
my
dear
holmes
oh
yes
i
did
you
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
roylott
cigar
now
of
course
that
suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be
a
communication
between
the
two
rooms
it
could
only
be
a
small
one
or
it
would
have
been
remarked
upon
at
the
coroner
inquiry
i
deduced
a
ventilator
but
what
harm
can
there
be
in
that
well
there
is
at
least
a
curious
coincidence
of
dates
a
ventilator
is
made
a
cord
is
hung
and
a
lady
who
sleeps
in
the
bed
dies
does
not
that
strike
you
i
can
not
as
yet
see
any
connection
did
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that
bed
no
it
was
clamped
to
the
floor
did
you
ever
see
a
bed
fastened
like
that
before
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
the
lady
could
not
move
her
bed
it
must
always
be
in
the
same
relative
position
to
the
ventilator
and
to
the
rope
or
so
we
may
call
it
since
it
was
clearly
never
meant
for
a
holmes
i
cried
i
seem
to
see
dimly
what
you
are
hinting
at
we
are
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
some
subtle
and
horrible
crime
subtle
enough
and
horrible
enough
when
a
doctor
does
go
wrong
he
is
the
first
of
criminals
he
has
nerve
and
he
has
knowledge
palmer
and
pritchard
were
among
the
heads
of
their
profession
this
man
strikes
even
deeper
but
i
think
watson
that
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
deeper
still
but
we
shall
have
horrors
enough
before
the
night
is
over
for
goodness
sake
let
us
have
a
quiet
pipe
and
turn
our
minds
for
a
few
hours
to
something
more
cheerful
about
nine
the
light
among
the
trees
was
extinguished
and
all
was
dark
in
the
direction
of
the
manor
house
two
hours
passed
slowly
away
and
then
suddenly
just
at
the
stroke
of
eleven
a
single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in
front
of
us
that
is
our
signal
said
holmes
springing
to
his
feet
it
comes
from
the
middle
window
as
we
passed
out
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
landlord
explaining
that
we
were
going
on
a
late
visit
to
an
acquaintance
and
that
it
was
possible
that
we
might
spend
the
night
there
a
moment
later
we
were
out
on
the
dark
road
a
chill
wind
blowing
in
our
faces
and
one
yellow
light
twinkling
in
front
of
us
through
the
gloom
to
guide
us
on
our
sombre
errand
there
was
little
difficulty
in
entering
the
grounds
for
unrepaired
breaches
gaped
in
the
old
park
wall
making
our
way
among
the
trees
we
reached
the
lawn
crossed
it
and
were
about
to
enter
through
the
window
when
out
from
a
clump
of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be
a
hideous
and
distorted
child
who
threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs
and
then
ran
swiftly
across
the
lawn
into
the
darkness
my
god
i
whispered
did
you
see
it
holmes
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as
i
his
hand
closed
like
a
vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
agitation
then
he
broke
into
a
low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
it
is
a
nice
household
he
murmured
that
is
the
baboon
i
had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
affected
there
was
a
cheetah
too
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
moment
i
confess
that
i
felt
easier
in
my
mind
when
after
following
holmes
example
and
slipping
off
my
shoes
i
found
myself
inside
the
bedroom
my
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
shutters
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
table
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
all
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
daytime
then
creeping
up
to
me
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hand
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
distinguish
the
words
the
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
plans
i
nodded
to
show
that
i
had
heard
we
must
sit
without
light
he
would
see
it
through
the
ventilator
i
nodded
again
do
not
go
asleep
your
very
life
may
depend
upon
it
have
your
pistol
ready
in
case
we
should
need
it
i
will
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
you
in
that
chair
i
took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
holmes
had
brought
up
a
long
thin
cane
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
him
by
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of
a
candle
then
he
turned
down
the
lamp
and
we
were
left
in
darkness
how
shall
i
ever
forget
that
dreadful
vigil
i
could
not
hear
a
sound
not
even
the
drawing
of
a
breath
and
yet
i
knew
that
my
companion
sat
within
a
few
feet
of
me
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
i
was
myself
the
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
light
and
we
waited
in
absolute
darkness
from
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of
a
and
once
at
our
very
window
a
long
drawn
catlike
whine
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
liberty
far
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
clock
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
hour
how
long
they
seemed
those
quarters
twelve
struck
and
one
and
two
and
three
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
befall
suddenly
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of
a
light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
ventilator
which
vanished
immediately
but
was
succeeded
by
a
strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
metal
someone
in
the
next
room
had
lit
a
i
heard
a
gentle
sound
of
movement
and
then
all
was
silent
once
more
though
the
smell
grew
stronger
for
half
an
hour
i
sat
with
straining
ears
then
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible
a
very
gentle
soothing
sound
like
that
of
a
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from
a
kettle
the
instant
that
we
heard
it
holmes
sprang
from
the
bed
struck
a
match
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
you
see
it
watson
he
yelled
you
see
it
but
i
saw
nothing
at
the
moment
when
holmes
struck
the
light
i
heard
a
low
clear
whistle
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
savagely
i
could
however
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
he
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which
i
have
ever
listened
it
swelled
up
louder
and
louder
a
hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
shriek
they
say
that
away
down
in
the
village
and
even
in
the
distant
parsonage
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
beds
it
struck
cold
to
our
hearts
and
i
stood
gazing
at
holmes
and
he
at
me
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
rose
what
can
it
mean
i
gasped
it
means
that
it
is
all
over
holmes
answered
and
perhaps
after
all
it
is
for
the
best
take
your
pistol
and
we
will
enter
roylott
room
with
a
grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
twice
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
within
then
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered
i
at
his
heels
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
hand
it
was
a
singular
sight
which
met
our
eyes
on
the
table
stood
a
with
the
shutter
half
open
throwing
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
safe
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
beside
this
table
on
the
wooden
chair
sat
grimesby
roylott
clad
in
a
long
grey
his
bare
ankles
protruding
beneath
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
turkish
slippers
across
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
day
his
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
dreadful
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
round
his
brow
he
had
a
peculiar
yellow
band
with
brownish
speckles
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
head
as
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
motion
the
band
the
speckled
band
whispered
holmes
i
took
a
step
forward
in
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
move
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
head
and
puffed
neck
of
a
loathsome
serpent
it
is
a
swamp
adder
cried
holmes
the
deadliest
snake
in
india
he
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
bitten
violence
does
in
truth
recoil
upon
the
violent
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
another
let
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
den
and
we
can
then
remove
miss
stoner
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
happened
as
he
spoke
he
drew
the
swiftly
from
the
dead
man
lap
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile
neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
and
carrying
it
at
arm
length
threw
it
into
the
iron
safe
which
he
closed
upon
it
such
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
grimesby
roylott
of
stoke
moran
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
prolong
a
narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great
a
length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
girl
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
harrow
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with
a
dangerous
pet
the
little
which
i
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
sherlock
holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
day
i
had
said
he
come
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
shows
my
dear
watson
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
data
the
presence
of
the
gipsies
and
the
use
of
the
word
which
was
used
by
the
poor
girl
no
doubt
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught
a
hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
match
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
scent
i
can
only
claim
the
merit
that
i
instantly
reconsidered
my
position
when
however
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
door
my
attention
was
speedily
drawn
as
i
have
already
remarked
to
you
to
this
ventilator
and
to
the
which
hung
down
to
the
bed
the
discovery
that
this
was
a
dummy
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as
a
bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
bed
the
idea
of
a
snake
instantly
occurred
to
me
and
when
i
coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with
a
supply
of
creatures
from
india
i
felt
that
i
was
probably
on
the
right
track
the
idea
of
using
a
form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such
a
one
as
would
occur
to
a
clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
had
an
eastern
training
the
rapidity
with
which
such
a
poison
would
take
effect
would
also
from
his
point
of
view
be
an
advantage
it
would
be
a
coroner
indeed
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
work
then
i
thought
of
the
whistle
of
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
victim
he
had
trained
it
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
saw
to
return
to
him
when
summoned
he
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
best
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
bed
it
might
or
might
not
bite
the
occupant
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for
a
week
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall
a
victim
i
had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever
i
had
entered
his
room
an
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
it
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
ventilator
the
sight
of
the
safe
the
saucer
of
milk
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
remained
the
metallic
clang
heard
by
miss
stoner
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
occupant
having
once
made
up
my
mind
you
know
the
steps
which
i
took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
proof
i
heard
the
creature
hiss
as
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
also
and
i
instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
it
with
the
result
of
driving
it
through
the
ventilator
and
also
with
the
result
of
causing
it
to
turn
upon
its
master
at
the
other
side
some
of
the
blows
of
my
cane
came
home
and
roused
its
snakish
temper
so
that
it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
saw
in
this
way
i
am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
grimesby
roylott
death
and
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
conscience
ix
the
adventure
of
the
engineer
thumb
of
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
intimacy
there
were
only
two
which
i
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
notice
that
of
hatherley
thumb
and
that
of
colonel
warburton
madness
of
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded
a
finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
observer
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
record
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
results
the
story
has
i
believe
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
newspapers
but
like
all
such
narratives
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in
a
single
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
eyes
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes
a
step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
truth
at
the
time
the
circumstances
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
effect
it
was
in
the
summer
of
not
long
after
my
marriage
that
the
events
occurred
which
i
am
now
about
to
summarise
i
had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
holmes
in
his
baker
street
rooms
although
i
continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
bohemian
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
us
my
practice
had
steadily
increased
and
as
i
happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
paddington
station
i
got
a
few
patients
from
among
the
officials
one
of
these
whom
i
had
cured
of
a
painful
and
lingering
disease
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
influence
one
morning
at
a
little
before
seven
i
was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
paddington
and
were
waiting
in
the
i
dressed
hurriedly
for
i
knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
trivial
and
hastened
downstairs
as
i
descended
my
old
ally
the
guard
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
him
i
got
him
here
he
whispered
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
he
all
right
what
is
it
then
i
asked
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
room
it
a
new
patient
he
whispered
i
thought
i
bring
him
round
myself
then
he
could
slip
away
there
he
is
all
safe
and
sound
i
must
go
now
doctor
i
have
my
dooties
just
the
same
as
you
and
off
he
went
this
trusty
tout
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
him
i
entered
my
and
found
a
gentleman
seated
by
the
table
he
was
quietly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
heather
tweed
with
a
soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
books
round
one
of
his
hands
he
had
a
handkerchief
wrapped
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
bloodstains
he
was
young
not
more
than
i
should
say
with
a
strong
masculine
face
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
agitation
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
control
i
am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
early
doctor
said
he
but
i
have
had
a
very
serious
accident
during
the
night
i
came
in
by
train
this
morning
and
on
inquiring
at
paddington
as
to
where
i
might
find
a
doctor
a
worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
here
i
gave
the
maid
a
card
but
i
see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
i
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
victor
hatherley
hydraulic
engineer
victoria
street
floor
that
was
the
name
style
and
abode
of
my
morning
visitor
i
regret
that
i
have
kept
you
waiting
said
i
sitting
down
in
my
you
are
fresh
from
a
night
journey
i
understand
which
is
in
itself
a
monotonous
occupation
oh
my
night
could
not
be
called
monotonous
said
he
and
laughed
he
laughed
very
heartily
with
a
high
ringing
note
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
sides
all
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
laugh
stop
it
i
cried
pull
yourself
together
and
i
poured
out
some
water
from
a
caraffe
it
was
useless
however
he
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon
a
strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
gone
presently
he
came
to
himself
once
more
very
weary
and
i
have
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
he
gasped
not
at
all
drink
this
i
dashed
some
brandy
into
the
water
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
cheeks
that
better
said
he
and
now
doctor
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
thumb
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
be
he
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
hand
it
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves
a
shudder
to
look
at
it
there
were
four
protruding
fingers
and
a
horrid
red
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
been
it
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
roots
good
heavens
i
cried
this
is
a
terrible
injury
it
must
have
bled
considerably
yes
it
did
i
fainted
when
it
was
done
and
i
think
that
i
must
have
been
senseless
for
a
long
time
when
i
came
to
i
found
that
it
was
still
bleeding
so
i
tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with
a
twig
excellent
you
should
have
been
a
surgeon
it
is
a
question
of
hydraulics
you
see
and
came
within
my
own
province
this
has
been
done
said
i
examining
the
wound
by
a
very
heavy
and
sharp
instrument
a
thing
like
a
cleaver
said
he
an
accident
i
presume
by
no
means
what
a
murderous
attack
very
murderous
indeed
you
horrify
me
i
sponged
the
wound
cleaned
it
dressed
it
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
bandages
he
lay
back
without
wincing
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
time
how
is
that
i
asked
when
i
had
finished
capital
between
your
brandy
and
your
bandage
i
feel
a
new
man
i
was
very
weak
but
i
have
had
a
good
deal
to
go
through
perhaps
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
matter
it
is
evidently
trying
to
your
nerves
oh
no
not
now
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
police
but
between
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
mine
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
statement
for
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
one
and
i
have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
up
and
even
if
they
believe
me
the
clues
which
i
can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is
a
question
whether
justice
will
be
done
ha
cried
i
if
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
problem
which
you
desire
to
see
solved
i
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
before
you
go
to
the
official
police
oh
i
have
heard
of
that
fellow
answered
my
visitor
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
up
though
of
course
i
must
use
the
official
police
as
well
would
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
him
i
do
better
i
take
you
round
to
him
myself
i
should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you
we
call
a
cab
and
go
together
we
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have
a
little
breakfast
with
him
do
you
feel
equal
to
it
yes
i
shall
not
feel
easy
until
i
have
told
my
story
then
my
servant
will
call
a
cab
and
i
shall
be
with
you
in
an
instant
i
rushed
upstairs
explained
the
matter
shortly
to
my
wife
and
in
five
minutes
was
inside
a
hansom
driving
with
my
new
acquaintance
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
was
as
i
expected
lounging
about
his
in
his
reading
the
agony
column
of
the
times
and
smoking
his
pipe
which
was
composed
of
all
the
plugs
and
dottles
left
from
his
smokes
of
the
day
before
all
carefully
dried
and
collected
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
he
received
us
in
his
quietly
genial
fashion
ordered
fresh
rashers
and
eggs
and
joined
us
in
a
hearty
meal
when
it
was
concluded
he
settled
our
new
acquaintance
upon
the
sofa
placed
a
pillow
beneath
his
head
and
laid
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
within
his
reach
it
is
easy
to
see
that
your
experience
has
been
no
common
one
hatherley
said
he
pray
lie
down
there
and
make
yourself
absolutely
at
home
tell
us
what
you
can
but
stop
when
you
are
tired
and
keep
up
your
strength
with
a
little
stimulant
thank
you
said
my
patient
but
i
have
felt
another
man
since
the
doctor
bandaged
me
and
i
think
that
your
breakfast
has
completed
the
cure
i
shall
take
up
as
little
of
your
valuable
time
as
possible
so
i
shall
start
at
once
upon
my
peculiar
experiences
holmes
sat
in
his
big
armchair
with
the
weary
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
nature
while
i
sat
opposite
to
him
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
us
you
must
know
said
he
that
i
am
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
london
by
profession
i
am
a
hydraulic
engineer
and
i
have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that
i
was
apprenticed
to
venner
matheson
the
firm
of
greenwich
two
years
ago
having
served
my
time
and
having
also
come
into
a
fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father
death
i
determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
victoria
street
i
suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business
a
dreary
experience
to
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
so
during
two
years
i
have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
job
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
me
my
gross
takings
amount
to
pounds
every
day
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon
i
waited
in
my
little
den
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
sink
and
i
came
to
believe
that
i
should
never
have
any
practice
at
all
yesterday
however
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
office
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
business
he
brought
up
a
card
too
with
the
name
of
lysander
stark
engraved
upon
it
close
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
himself
a
man
rather
over
the
middle
size
but
of
an
exceeding
thinness
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
so
thin
a
man
his
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
chin
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
bones
yet
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
habit
and
due
to
no
disease
for
his
eye
was
bright
his
step
brisk
and
his
bearing
assured
he
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
and
his
age
i
should
judge
would
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
hatherley
said
he
with
something
of
a
german
accent
have
been
recommended
to
me
hatherley
as
being
a
man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving
a
secret
i
bowed
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
address
i
ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good
a
character
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
moment
i
have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
london
is
quite
correct
i
answered
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
can
not
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
qualifications
i
understand
that
it
was
on
a
professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
so
but
you
will
find
that
all
i
say
is
really
to
the
point
i
have
a
professional
commission
for
you
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
essential
absolute
secrecy
you
understand
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from
a
man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
i
promise
to
keep
a
secret
said
i
may
absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
so
he
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
i
spoke
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
eye
you
promise
then
said
he
at
last
i
promise
and
complete
silence
before
during
and
after
no
reference
to
the
matter
at
all
either
in
word
or
writing
have
already
given
you
my
word
good
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
door
the
passage
outside
was
empty
all
right
said
he
coming
back
know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master
affairs
now
we
can
talk
in
safety
he
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
look
a
feeling
of
repulsion
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
fleshless
man
even
my
dread
of
losing
a
client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
impatience
beg
that
you
will
state
your
business
sir
said
i
time
is
of
value
heaven
forgive
me
for
that
last
sentence
but
the
words
came
to
my
lips
would
fifty
guineas
for
a
night
work
suit
you
he
asked
admirably
say
a
night
work
but
an
hour
would
be
nearer
the
mark
i
simply
want
your
opinion
about
a
hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
gear
if
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
ourselves
what
do
you
think
of
such
a
commission
as
that
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
munificent
so
we
shall
want
you
to
come
by
the
last
train
to
eyford
in
berkshire
it
is
a
little
place
near
the
borders
of
oxfordshire
and
within
seven
miles
of
reading
there
is
a
train
from
paddington
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
good
shall
come
down
in
a
carriage
to
meet
you
is
a
drive
then
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
country
it
is
a
good
seven
miles
from
eyford
station
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
midnight
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of
a
train
back
i
should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
night
we
could
easily
give
you
a
is
very
awkward
could
i
not
come
at
some
more
convenient
hour
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
late
it
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
you
a
young
and
unknown
man
a
fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
profession
still
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
business
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
so
i
thought
of
the
fifty
guineas
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
me
at
all
said
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
wishes
i
should
like
however
to
understand
a
little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do
so
it
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
curiosity
i
have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
you
i
suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
eavesdroppers
the
matter
stands
thus
you
are
probably
aware
that
is
a
valuable
product
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
england
have
heard
so
little
time
ago
i
bought
a
small
place
a
very
small
place
within
ten
miles
of
reading
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
a
deposit
of
in
one
of
my
fields
on
examining
it
however
i
found
that
this
deposit
was
a
comparatively
small
one
and
that
it
formed
a
link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
left
both
of
them
however
in
the
grounds
of
my
neighbours
these
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as
a
naturally
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
value
but
unfortunately
i
had
no
capital
by
which
i
could
do
this
i
took
a
few
of
my
friends
into
the
secret
however
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
fields
this
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
time
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected
a
hydraulic
press
this
press
as
i
have
already
explained
has
got
out
of
order
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
subject
we
guard
our
secret
very
jealously
however
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
house
it
would
soon
rouse
inquiry
and
then
if
the
facts
came
out
it
would
be
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
plans
that
is
why
i
have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
a
human
being
that
you
are
going
to
eyford
i
hope
that
i
make
it
all
plain
quite
follow
you
said
i
only
point
which
i
could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of
a
hydraulic
press
in
excavating
which
as
i
understand
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from
a
pit
said
he
carelessly
have
our
own
process
we
compress
the
earth
into
bricks
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
are
but
that
is
a
mere
detail
i
have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
now
hatherley
and
i
have
shown
you
how
i
trust
you
he
rose
as
he
spoke
shall
expect
you
then
at
eyford
at
shall
certainly
be
there
not
a
word
to
a
soul
he
looked
at
me
with
a
last
long
questioning
gaze
and
then
pressing
my
hand
in
a
cold
dank
grasp
he
hurried
from
the
room
well
when
i
came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood
i
was
very
much
astonished
as
you
may
both
think
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
intrusted
to
me
on
the
one
hand
of
course
i
was
glad
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what
i
should
have
asked
had
i
set
a
price
upon
my
own
services
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
ones
on
the
other
hand
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
me
and
i
could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
midnight
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest
i
should
tell
anyone
of
my
errand
however
i
threw
all
fears
to
the
winds
ate
a
hearty
supper
drove
to
paddington
and
started
off
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
tongue
at
reading
i
had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
station
however
i
was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
eyford
and
i
reached
the
little
station
after
eleven
i
was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
there
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save
a
single
sleepy
porter
with
a
lantern
as
i
passed
out
through
the
wicket
gate
however
i
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
without
a
word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into
a
carriage
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open
he
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
side
tapped
on
the
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go
one
horse
interjected
holmes
yes
only
one
did
you
observe
the
colour
yes
i
saw
it
by
the
when
i
was
stepping
into
the
carriage
it
was
a
chestnut
or
fresh
oh
fresh
and
glossy
thank
you
i
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you
pray
continue
your
most
interesting
statement
away
we
went
then
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
hour
colonel
lysander
stark
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
miles
but
i
should
think
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
go
and
from
the
time
that
we
took
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
twelve
he
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
time
and
i
was
aware
more
than
once
when
i
glanced
in
his
direction
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
intensity
the
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
world
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
terribly
i
tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
were
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
glass
and
i
could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of
a
passing
light
now
and
then
i
hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
monosyllables
and
the
conversation
soon
flagged
at
last
however
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of
a
and
the
carriage
came
to
a
stand
colonel
lysander
stark
sprang
out
and
as
i
followed
after
him
pulled
me
swiftly
into
a
porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
us
we
stepped
as
it
were
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
hall
so
that
i
failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
house
the
instant
that
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
us
and
i
heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
away
it
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
house
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
breath
suddenly
a
door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and
a
long
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
direction
it
grew
broader
and
a
woman
appeared
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
which
she
held
above
her
head
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
us
i
could
see
that
she
was
pretty
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress
i
knew
that
it
was
a
rich
material
she
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
in
a
tone
as
though
asking
a
question
and
when
my
companion
answered
in
a
gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such
a
start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
hand
colonel
stark
went
up
to
her
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
then
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
come
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for
a
few
minutes
said
he
throwing
open
another
door
it
was
a
quiet
little
plainly
furnished
room
with
a
round
table
in
the
centre
on
which
several
german
books
were
scattered
colonel
stark
laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
a
harmonium
beside
the
door
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
instant
said
he
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
i
glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
table
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
german
i
could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
science
the
others
being
volumes
of
poetry
then
i
walked
across
to
the
window
hoping
that
i
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
but
an
oak
shutter
heavily
barred
was
folded
across
it
it
was
a
wonderfully
silent
house
there
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
passage
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
still
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me
who
were
these
german
people
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
strange
place
and
where
was
the
place
i
was
ten
miles
or
so
from
eyford
that
was
all
i
knew
but
whether
north
south
east
or
west
i
had
no
idea
for
that
matter
reading
and
possibly
other
large
towns
were
within
that
radius
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
secluded
after
all
yet
it
was
quite
certain
from
the
absolute
stillness
that
we
were
in
the
country
i
paced
up
and
down
the
room
humming
a
tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that
i
was
thoroughly
earning
my
fee
suddenly
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
stillness
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
open
the
woman
was
standing
in
the
aperture
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
her
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
face
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
she
was
sick
with
fear
and
the
sight
sent
a
chill
to
my
own
heart
she
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
silent
and
she
shot
a
few
whispered
words
of
broken
english
at
me
her
eyes
glancing
back
like
those
of
a
frightened
horse
into
the
gloom
behind
her
would
go
said
she
trying
hard
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
speak
calmly
would
go
i
should
not
stay
here
there
is
no
good
for
you
to
do
madam
said
i
have
not
yet
done
what
i
came
for
i
can
not
possibly
leave
until
i
have
seen
the
machine
is
not
worth
your
while
to
wait
she
went
on
can
pass
through
the
door
no
one
hinders
and
then
seeing
that
i
smiled
and
shook
my
head
she
suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made
a
step
forward
with
her
hands
wrung
together
the
love
of
heaven
she
whispered
away
from
here
before
it
is
too
late
but
i
am
somewhat
headstrong
by
nature
and
the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in
the
way
i
thought
of
my
fee
of
my
wearisome
journey
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before
me
was
it
all
to
go
for
nothing
why
should
i
slink
away
without
having
carried
out
my
commission
and
without
the
payment
which
was
my
due
this
woman
might
for
all
i
knew
be
a
monomaniac
with
a
stout
bearing
therefore
though
her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than
i
cared
to
confess
i
still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where
i
was
she
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
a
door
slammed
overhead
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
she
listened
for
an
instant
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
despairing
gesture
and
vanished
as
suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
the
newcomers
were
colonel
lysander
stark
and
a
short
thick
man
with
a
chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
chin
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
ferguson
is
my
secretary
and
manager
said
the
colonel
the
way
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
left
this
door
shut
just
now
i
fear
that
you
have
felt
the
draught
the
contrary
said
i
opened
the
door
myself
because
i
felt
the
room
to
be
a
little
close
he
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
me
we
had
better
proceed
to
business
then
said
he
ferguson
and
i
will
take
you
up
to
see
the
machine
had
better
put
my
hat
on
i
suppose
no
it
is
in
the
house
you
dig
in
the
house
no
this
is
only
where
we
compress
it
but
never
mind
that
all
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
it
we
went
upstairs
together
the
colonel
first
with
the
lamp
the
fat
manager
and
i
behind
him
it
was
a
labyrinth
of
an
old
house
with
corridors
passages
narrow
winding
staircases
and
little
low
doors
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
them
there
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
floor
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
walls
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
green
unhealthy
blotches
i
tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
possible
but
i
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
lady
even
though
i
disregarded
them
and
i
kept
a
keen
eye
upon
my
two
companions
ferguson
appeared
to
be
a
morose
and
silent
man
but
i
could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least
a
colonel
lysander
stark
stopped
at
last
before
a
low
door
which
he
unlocked
within
was
a
small
square
room
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
time
ferguson
remained
outside
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
in
are
now
said
he
within
the
hydraulic
press
and
it
would
be
a
particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
on
the
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
piston
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
floor
there
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
force
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
you
the
machine
goes
readily
enough
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
it
and
it
has
lost
a
little
of
its
force
perhaps
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
right
i
took
the
lamp
from
him
and
i
examined
the
machine
very
thoroughly
it
was
indeed
a
gigantic
one
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
pressure
when
i
passed
outside
however
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
it
i
knew
at
once
by
the
whishing
sound
that
there
was
a
slight
leakage
which
allowed
a
regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
cylinders
an
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of
a
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
worked
this
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
power
and
i
pointed
it
out
to
my
companions
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
right
when
i
had
made
it
clear
to
them
i
returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took
a
good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
it
was
obvious
at
a
glance
that
the
story
of
the
was
the
merest
fabrication
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate
a
purpose
the
walls
were
of
wood
but
the
floor
consisted
of
a
large
iron
trough
and
when
i
came
to
examine
it
i
could
see
a
crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
it
i
had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when
i
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
in
german
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
me
are
you
doing
there
he
asked
i
felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate
a
story
as
that
which
he
had
told
me
was
admiring
your
said
i
think
that
i
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if
i
knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
used
the
instant
that
i
uttered
the
words
i
regretted
the
rashness
of
my
speech
his
face
set
hard
and
a
baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
eyes
well
said
he
shall
know
all
about
the
machine
he
took
a
step
backward
slammed
the
little
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
i
rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
handle
but
it
was
quite
secure
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
shoves
i
yelled
colonel
let
me
out
and
then
suddenly
in
the
silence
i
heard
a
sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
mouth
it
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
cylinder
he
had
set
the
engine
at
work
the
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where
i
had
placed
it
when
examining
the
trough
by
its
light
i
saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
me
slowly
jerkily
but
as
none
knew
better
than
myself
with
a
force
which
must
within
a
minute
grind
me
to
a
shapeless
pulp
i
threw
myself
screaming
against
the
door
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
lock
i
implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
out
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
cries
the
ceiling
was
only
a
foot
or
two
above
my
head
and
with
my
hand
upraised
i
could
feel
its
hard
rough
surface
then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which
i
met
it
if
i
lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
spine
and
i
shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
snap
easier
the
other
way
perhaps
and
yet
had
i
the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
me
already
i
was
unable
to
stand
erect
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought
a
gush
of
hope
back
to
my
heart
i
have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
iron
the
walls
were
of
wood
as
i
gave
a
last
hurried
glance
around
i
saw
a
thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
boards
which
broadened
and
broadened
as
a
small
panel
was
pushed
backward
for
an
instant
i
could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed
a
door
which
led
away
from
death
the
next
instant
i
threw
myself
through
and
lay
upon
the
other
side
the
panel
had
closed
again
behind
me
but
the
crash
of
the
lamp
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
metal
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
escape
i
was
recalled
to
myself
by
a
frantic
plucking
at
my
wrist
and
i
found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of
a
narrow
corridor
while
a
woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
hand
while
she
held
a
candle
in
her
right
it
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning
i
had
so
foolishly
rejected
come
she
cried
breathlessly
will
be
here
in
a
moment
they
will
see
that
you
are
not
there
oh
do
not
waste
the
time
but
come
this
time
at
least
i
did
not
scorn
her
advice
i
staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down
a
winding
stair
the
latter
led
to
another
broad
passage
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
voices
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
beneath
my
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit
end
then
she
threw
open
a
door
which
led
into
a
bedroom
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
is
your
only
chance
said
she
is
high
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
it
as
she
spoke
a
light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
and
i
saw
the
lean
figure
of
colonel
lysander
stark
rushing
forward
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
weapon
like
a
butcher
cleaver
in
the
other
i
rushed
across
the
bedroom
flung
open
the
window
and
looked
out
how
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
moonlight
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
down
i
clambered
out
upon
the
sill
but
i
hesitated
to
jump
until
i
should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
me
if
she
were
then
at
any
risks
i
was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
assistance
the
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
door
pushing
his
way
past
her
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
fritz
she
cried
in
english
your
promise
after
the
last
time
you
said
it
should
not
be
again
he
will
be
silent
oh
he
will
be
silent
are
mad
elise
he
shouted
struggling
to
break
away
from
her
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
he
has
seen
too
much
let
me
pass
i
say
he
dashed
her
to
one
side
and
rushing
to
the
window
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
weapon
i
had
let
myself
go
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
sill
when
his
blow
fell
i
was
conscious
of
a
dull
pain
my
grip
loosened
and
i
fell
into
the
garden
below
i
was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
fall
so
i
picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as
i
could
run
for
i
understood
that
i
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
yet
suddenly
however
as
i
ran
a
deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
me
i
glanced
down
at
my
hand
which
was
throbbing
painfully
and
then
for
the
first
time
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
wound
i
endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
it
but
there
came
a
sudden
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
next
moment
i
fell
in
a
dead
faint
among
the
how
long
i
remained
unconscious
i
can
not
tell
it
must
have
been
a
very
long
time
for
the
moon
had
sunk
and
a
bright
morning
was
breaking
when
i
came
to
myself
my
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
dew
and
my
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
thumb
the
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night
adventure
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that
i
might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
pursuers
but
to
my
astonishment
when
i
came
to
look
round
me
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
seen
i
had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
highroad
and
just
a
little
lower
down
was
a
long
building
which
proved
upon
my
approaching
it
to
be
the
very
station
at
which
i
had
arrived
upon
the
previous
night
were
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
hand
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
dream
half
dazed
i
went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
train
there
would
be
one
to
reading
in
less
than
an
hour
the
same
porter
was
on
duty
i
found
as
had
been
there
when
i
arrived
i
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
colonel
lysander
stark
the
name
was
strange
to
him
had
he
observed
a
carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
me
no
he
had
not
was
there
a
anywhere
near
there
was
one
about
three
miles
off
it
was
too
far
for
me
to
go
weak
and
ill
as
i
was
i
determined
to
wait
until
i
got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
police
it
was
a
little
past
six
when
i
arrived
so
i
went
first
to
have
my
wound
dressed
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
here
i
put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
advise
we
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative
then
sherlock
holmes
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his
cuttings
here
is
an
advertisement
which
will
interest
you
said
he
it
appeared
in
all
the
papers
about
a
year
ago
listen
to
this
on
the
jeremiah
hayling
aged
a
hydraulic
engineer
left
his
lodgings
at
ten
at
night
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
was
dressed
in
etc
ha
that
represents
the
last
time
that
the
colonel
needed
to
have
his
machine
overhauled
i
fancy
good
heavens
cried
my
patient
then
that
explains
what
the
girl
said
undoubtedly
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was
a
cool
and
desperate
man
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
game
like
those
pirates
who
will
leave
no
survivor
from
a
captured
ship
well
every
moment
now
is
precious
so
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
shall
go
down
to
scotland
yard
at
once
as
a
preliminary
to
starting
for
eyford
some
three
hours
or
so
afterwards
we
were
all
in
the
train
together
bound
from
reading
to
the
little
berkshire
village
there
were
sherlock
holmes
the
hydraulic
engineer
inspector
bradstreet
of
scotland
yard
a
man
and
myself
bradstreet
had
spread
an
ordnance
map
of
the
county
out
upon
the
seat
and
was
busy
with
his
compasses
drawing
a
circle
with
eyford
for
its
centre
there
you
are
said
he
that
circle
is
drawn
at
a
radius
of
ten
miles
from
the
village
the
place
we
want
must
be
somewhere
near
that
line
you
said
ten
miles
i
think
sir
it
was
an
hour
good
drive
and
you
think
that
they
brought
you
back
all
that
way
when
you
were
unconscious
they
must
have
done
so
i
have
a
confused
memory
too
of
having
been
lifted
and
conveyed
somewhere
what
i
can
not
understand
said
i
is
why
they
should
have
spared
you
when
they
found
you
lying
fainting
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
villain
was
softened
by
the
woman
entreaties
i
hardly
think
that
likely
i
never
saw
a
more
inexorable
face
in
my
life
oh
we
shall
soon
clear
up
all
that
said
bradstreet
well
i
have
drawn
my
circle
and
i
only
wish
i
knew
at
what
point
upon
it
the
folk
that
we
are
in
search
of
are
to
be
found
i
think
i
could
lay
my
finger
on
it
said
holmes
quietly
really
now
cried
the
inspector
you
have
formed
your
opinion
come
now
we
shall
see
who
agrees
with
you
i
say
it
is
south
for
the
country
is
more
deserted
there
and
i
say
east
said
my
patient
i
am
for
west
remarked
the
man
there
are
several
quiet
little
villages
up
there
and
i
am
for
north
said
i
because
there
are
no
hills
there
and
our
friend
says
that
he
did
not
notice
the
carriage
go
up
any
come
cried
the
inspector
laughing
it
a
very
pretty
diversity
of
opinion
we
have
boxed
the
compass
among
us
who
do
you
give
your
casting
vote
to
you
are
all
wrong
but
we
ca
all
be
oh
yes
you
can
this
is
my
point
he
placed
his
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
this
is
where
we
shall
find
them
but
the
drive
gasped
hatherley
six
out
and
six
back
nothing
simpler
you
say
yourself
that
the
horse
was
fresh
and
glossy
when
you
got
in
how
could
it
be
that
if
it
had
gone
twelve
miles
over
heavy
roads
indeed
it
is
a
likely
ruse
enough
observed
bradstreet
thoughtfully
of
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
gang
none
at
all
said
holmes
they
are
coiners
on
a
large
scale
and
have
used
the
machine
to
form
the
amalgam
which
has
taken
the
place
of
silver
we
have
known
for
some
time
that
a
clever
gang
was
at
work
said
the
inspector
they
have
been
turning
out
by
the
thousand
we
even
traced
them
as
far
as
reading
but
could
get
no
farther
for
they
had
covered
their
traces
in
a
way
that
showed
that
they
were
very
old
hands
but
now
thanks
to
this
lucky
chance
i
think
that
we
have
got
them
right
enough
but
the
inspector
was
mistaken
for
those
criminals
were
not
destined
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
as
we
rolled
into
eyford
station
we
saw
a
gigantic
column
of
smoke
which
streamed
up
from
behind
a
small
clump
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
and
hung
like
an
immense
ostrich
feather
over
the
landscape
a
house
on
fire
asked
bradstreet
as
the
train
steamed
off
again
on
its
way
yes
sir
said
the
when
did
it
break
out
i
hear
that
it
was
during
the
night
sir
but
it
has
got
worse
and
the
whole
place
is
in
a
blaze
whose
house
is
it
dr
becher
tell
me
broke
in
the
engineer
is
becher
a
german
very
thin
with
a
long
sharp
nose
the
laughed
heartily
no
sir
becher
is
an
englishman
and
there
is
a
man
in
the
parish
who
has
a
waistcoat
but
he
has
a
gentleman
staying
with
him
a
patient
as
i
understand
who
is
a
foreigner
and
he
looks
as
if
a
little
good
berkshire
beef
would
do
him
no
harm
the
had
not
finished
his
speech
before
we
were
all
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
the
road
topped
a
low
hill
and
there
was
a
great
widespread
whitewashed
building
in
front
of
us
spouting
fire
at
every
chink
and
window
while
in
the
garden
in
front
three
were
vainly
striving
to
keep
the
flames
under
that
it
cried
hatherley
in
intense
excitement
there
is
the
and
there
are
the
where
i
lay
that
second
window
is
the
one
that
i
jumped
from
well
at
least
said
holmes
you
have
had
your
revenge
upon
them
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
your
which
when
it
was
crushed
in
the
press
set
fire
to
the
wooden
walls
though
no
doubt
they
were
too
excited
in
the
chase
after
you
to
observe
it
at
the
time
now
keep
your
eyes
open
in
this
crowd
for
your
friends
of
last
night
though
i
very
much
fear
that
they
are
a
good
hundred
miles
off
by
now
and
holmes
fears
came
to
be
realised
for
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
woman
the
sinister
german
or
the
morose
englishman
early
that
morning
a
peasant
had
met
a
cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
reading
but
there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
disappeared
and
even
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
whereabouts
the
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
within
and
still
more
so
by
discovering
a
newly
severed
human
thumb
upon
a
of
the
second
floor
about
sunset
however
their
efforts
were
at
last
successful
and
they
subdued
the
flames
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
that
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
piping
not
a
trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
dearly
large
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
but
no
coins
were
to
be
found
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes
which
have
been
already
referred
to
how
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever
a
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
mould
which
told
us
a
very
plain
tale
he
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
ones
on
the
whole
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
englishman
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
companion
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
danger
well
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
london
it
has
been
a
pretty
business
for
me
i
have
lost
my
thumb
and
i
have
lost
a
fee
and
what
have
i
gained
experience
said
holmes
laughing
indirectly
it
may
be
of
value
you
know
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
existence
x
the
adventure
of
the
noble
bachelor
the
lord
simon
marriage
and
its
curious
termination
have
long
ceased
to
be
a
subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves
fresh
scandals
have
eclipsed
it
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
drama
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
public
and
as
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
had
a
considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
up
i
feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
episode
it
was
a
few
weeks
before
my
own
marriage
during
the
days
when
i
was
still
sharing
rooms
with
holmes
in
baker
street
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find
a
letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
him
i
had
remained
indoors
all
day
for
the
weather
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
to
rain
with
high
autumnal
winds
and
the
jezail
bullet
which
i
had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as
a
relic
of
my
afghan
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
persistence
with
my
body
in
one
and
my
legs
upon
another
i
had
surrounded
myself
with
a
cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
last
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
day
i
tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
listless
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
noble
correspondent
could
be
here
is
a
very
fashionable
epistle
i
remarked
as
he
entered
your
morning
letters
if
i
remember
right
were
from
a
and
a
yes
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
variety
he
answered
smiling
and
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
interesting
this
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon
a
man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
lie
he
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
contents
oh
come
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
interest
after
all
not
social
then
no
distinctly
professional
and
from
a
noble
client
one
of
the
highest
in
england
my
dear
fellow
i
congratulate
you
i
assure
you
watson
without
affectation
that
the
status
of
my
client
is
a
matter
of
less
moment
to
me
than
the
interest
of
his
case
it
is
just
possible
however
that
that
also
may
not
be
wanting
in
this
new
investigation
you
have
been
reading
the
papers
diligently
of
late
have
you
not
it
looks
like
it
said
i
ruefully
pointing
to
a
huge
bundle
in
the
corner
i
have
had
nothing
else
to
do
it
is
fortunate
for
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
post
me
up
i
read
nothing
except
the
criminal
news
and
the
agony
column
the
latter
is
always
instructive
but
if
you
have
followed
recent
events
so
closely
you
must
have
read
about
lord
simon
and
his
wedding
oh
yes
with
the
deepest
interest
that
is
well
the
letter
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
is
from
lord
simon
i
will
read
it
to
you
and
in
return
you
must
turn
over
these
papers
and
let
me
have
whatever
bears
upon
the
matter
this
is
what
he
says
dear
sherlock
holmes
lord
backwater
tells
me
that
i
may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
your
judgment
and
discretion
i
have
determined
therefore
to
call
upon
you
and
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
the
very
painful
event
which
has
occurred
in
connection
with
my
wedding
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
is
acting
already
in
the
matter
but
he
assures
me
that
he
sees
no
objection
to
your
and
that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might
be
of
some
assistance
i
will
call
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
should
you
have
any
other
engagement
at
that
time
i
hope
that
you
will
postpone
it
as
this
matter
is
of
paramount
importance
yours
faithfully
st
simon
it
is
dated
from
grosvenor
mansions
written
with
a
quill
pen
and
the
noble
lord
has
had
the
misfortune
to
get
a
smear
of
ink
upon
the
outer
side
of
his
right
little
finger
remarked
holmes
as
he
folded
up
the
epistle
he
says
four
it
is
three
now
he
will
be
here
in
an
hour
then
i
have
just
time
with
your
assistance
to
get
clear
upon
the
subject
turn
over
those
papers
and
arrange
the
extracts
in
their
order
of
time
while
i
take
a
glance
as
to
who
our
client
is
he
picked
a
volume
from
a
line
of
books
of
reference
beside
the
mantelpiece
here
he
is
said
he
sitting
down
and
flattening

his
knee

a

sable
born
in
he
years
of
age
which
is
mature
for

was
for
the
colonies
in
a
late
administration
the

his
father
was
at
one
time
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
they

by
direct

and
tudor
on
the
distaff
side
ha
well
there
is
nothing
very
instructive
in
all
this
i
think
that
i
must
turn
to
you
watson
for
something
more
solid
i
have
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
what
i
want
said
i
for
the
facts
are
quite
recent
and
the
matter
struck
me
as
remarkable
i
feared
to
refer
them
to
you
however
as
i
knew
that
you
had
an
inquiry
on
hand
and
that
you
disliked
the
intrusion
of
other
matters
oh
you
mean
the
little
problem
of
the
grosvenor
square
furniture
van
that
is
quite
cleared
up
now
though
indeed
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
pray
give
me
the
results
of
your
newspaper
selections
here
is
the
first
notice
which
i
can
find
it
is
in
the
personal
column
of
the
morning
post
and
dates
as
you
see
some
weeks
back
marriage
has
been
arranged
it
says
will
if
rumour
is
correct
very
shortly
take
place
between
lord
robert
simon
second
son
of
the
duke
of
balmoral
and
miss
hatty
doran
the
only
daughter
of
aloysius
doran
of
san
francisco
that
is
all
terse
and
to
the
point
remarked
holmes
stretching
his
long
thin
legs
towards
the
fire
there
was
a
paragraph
amplifying
this
in
one
of
the
society
papers
of
the
same
week
ah
here
it
is
will
soon
be
a
call
for
protection
in
the
marriage
market
for
the
present
principle
appears
to
tell
heavily
against
our
home
product
one
by
one
the
management
of
the
noble
houses
of
great
britain
is
passing
into
the
hands
of
our
fair
cousins
from
across
the
atlantic
an
important
addition
has
been
made
during
the
last
week
to
the
list
of
the
prizes
which
have
been
borne
away
by
these
charming
invaders
lord
simon
who
has
shown
himself
for
over
twenty
years
proof
against
the
little
god
arrows
has
now
definitely
announced
his
approaching
marriage
with
miss
hatty
doran
the
fascinating
daughter
of
a
california
millionaire
miss
doran
whose
graceful
figure
and
striking
face
attracted
much
attention
at
the
westbury
house
festivities
is
an
only
child
and
it
is
currently
reported
that
her
dowry
will
run
to
considerably
over
the
six
figures
with
expectancies
for
the
future
as
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
duke
of
balmoral
has
been
compelled
to
sell
his
pictures
within
the
last
few
years
and
as
lord
simon
has
no
property
of
his
own
save
the
small
estate
of
birchmoor
it
is
obvious
that
the
californian
heiress
is
not
the
only
gainer
by
an
alliance
which
will
enable
her
to
make
the
easy
and
common
transition
from
a
republican
lady
to
a
british
peeress
anything
else
asked
holmes
yawning
oh
yes
plenty
then
there
is
another
note
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
one
that
it
would
be
at
george
hanover
square
that
only
half
a
dozen
intimate
friends
would
be
invited
and
that
the
party
would
return
to
the
furnished
house
at
lancaster
gate
which
has
been
taken
by
aloysius
doran
two
days
later
that
is
on
wednesday
last
there
is
a
curt
announcement
that
the
wedding
had
taken
place
and
that
the
honeymoon
would
be
passed
at
lord
backwater
place
near
petersfield
those
are
all
the
notices
which
appeared
before
the
disappearance
of
the
bride
before
the
what
asked
holmes
with
a
start
the
vanishing
of
the
lady
when
did
she
vanish
then
at
the
wedding
breakfast
indeed
this
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
be
quite
dramatic
in
fact
yes
it
struck
me
as
being
a
little
out
of
the
common
they
often
vanish
before
the
ceremony
and
occasionally
during
the
honeymoon
but
i
can
not
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
this
pray
let
me
have
the
details
i
warn
you
that
they
are
very
incomplete
perhaps
we
may
make
them
less
so
such
as
they
are
they
are
set
forth
in
a
single
article
of
a
morning
paper
of
yesterday
which
i
will
read
to
you
it
is
headed
occurrence
at
a
fashionable
wedding
family
of
lord
robert
simon
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
wedding
the
ceremony
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
yesterday
occurred
on
the
previous
morning
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
about
in
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
up
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is
a
common
subject
for
conversation
ceremony
which
was
performed
at
george
hanover
square
was
a
very
quiet
one
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
bride
aloysius
doran
the
duchess
of
balmoral
lord
backwater
lord
eustace
and
lady
clara
simon
the
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
bridegroom
and
lady
alicia
whittington
the
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
aloysius
doran
at
lancaster
gate
where
breakfast
had
been
prepared
it
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by
a
woman
whose
name
has
not
been
ascertained
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
party
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
lord
simon
it
was
only
after
a
painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
footman
the
bride
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
interruption
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
when
she
complained
of
a
sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
room
her
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
comment
her
father
followed
her
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
instant
caught
up
an
ulster
and
bonnet
and
hurried
down
to
the
passage
one
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
lady
leave
the
house
thus
apparelled
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
mistress
believing
her
to
be
with
the
company
on
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
disappeared
aloysius
doran
in
conjunction
with
the
bridegroom
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
police
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
made
which
will
probably
result
in
a
speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
business
up
to
a
late
hour
last
night
however
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
lady
there
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
matter
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
disturbance
in
the
belief
that
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
bride
and
is
that
all
only
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
papers
but
it
is
a
suggestive
one
and
it
is
that
miss
flora
millar
the
lady
who
had
caused
the
disturbance
has
actually
been
arrested
it
appears
that
she
was
formerly
a
danseuse
at
the
allegro
and
that
she
has
known
the
bridegroom
for
some
years
there
are
no
further
particulars
and
the
whole
case
is
in
your
hands
now
so
far
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
public
press
and
an
exceedingly
interesting
case
it
appears
to
be
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
worlds
but
there
is
a
ring
at
the
bell
watson
and
as
the
clock
makes
it
a
few
minutes
after
four
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
will
prove
to
be
our
noble
client
do
not
dream
of
going
watson
for
i
very
much
prefer
having
a
witness
if
only
as
a
check
to
my
own
memory
lord
robert
simon
announced
our
throwing
open
the
door
a
gentleman
entered
with
a
pleasant
cultured
face
and
pale
with
something
perhaps
of
petulance
about
the
mouth
and
with
the
steady
eye
of
a
man
whose
pleasant
lot
it
had
ever
been
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed
his
manner
was
brisk
and
yet
his
general
appearance
gave
an
undue
impression
of
age
for
he
had
a
slight
forward
stoop
and
a
little
bend
of
the
knees
as
he
walked
his
hair
too
as
he
swept
off
his
very
hat
was
grizzled
round
the
edges
and
thin
upon
the
top
as
to
his
dress
it
was
careful
to
the
verge
of
foppishness
with
high
collar
black
white
waistcoat
yellow
gloves
shoes
and
gaiters
he
advanced
slowly
into
the
room
turning
his
head
from
left
to
right
and
swinging
in
his
right
hand
the
cord
which
held
his
golden
eyeglasses
lord
simon
said
holmes
rising
and
bowing
pray
take
the
this
is
my
friend
and
colleague
watson
draw
up
a
little
to
the
fire
and
we
will
talk
this
matter
over
a
most
painful
matter
to
me
as
you
can
most
readily
imagine
holmes
i
have
been
cut
to
the
quick
i
understand
that
you
have
already
managed
several
delicate
cases
of
this
sort
sir
though
i
presume
that
they
were
hardly
from
the
same
class
of
society
no
i
am
descending
i
beg
pardon
my
last
client
of
the
sort
was
a
king
oh
really
i
had
no
idea
and
which
king
the
king
of
scandinavia
what
had
he
lost
his
wife
you
can
understand
said
holmes
suavely
that
i
extend
to
the
affairs
of
my
other
clients
the
same
secrecy
which
i
promise
to
you
in
yours
of
course
very
right
very
right
i
sure
i
beg
pardon
as
to
my
own
case
i
am
ready
to
give
you
any
information
which
may
assist
you
in
forming
an
opinion
thank
you
i
have
already
learned
all
that
is
in
the
public
prints
nothing
more
i
presume
that
i
may
take
it
as
correct
this
article
for
example
as
to
the
disappearance
of
the
bride
lord
simon
glanced
over
it
yes
it
is
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
needs
a
great
deal
of
supplementing
before
anyone
could
offer
an
opinion
i
think
that
i
may
arrive
at
my
facts
most
directly
by
questioning
you
pray
do
so
when
did
you
first
meet
miss
hatty
doran
in
san
francisco
a
year
ago
you
were
travelling
in
the
states
yes
did
you
become
engaged
then
no
but
you
were
on
a
friendly
footing
i
was
amused
by
her
society
and
she
could
see
that
i
was
amused
her
father
is
very
rich
he
is
said
to
be
the
richest
man
on
the
pacific
slope
and
how
did
he
make
his
money
in
mining
he
had
nothing
a
few
years
ago
then
he
struck
gold
invested
it
and
came
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
now
what
is
your
own
impression
as
to
the
young
lady
your
wife
character
the
nobleman
swung
his
glasses
a
little
faster
and
stared
down
into
the
fire
you
see
holmes
said
he
my
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became
a
rich
man
during
that
time
she
ran
free
in
a
mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
mountains
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
nature
rather
than
from
the
schoolmaster
she
is
what
we
call
in
england
a
tomboy
with
a
strong
nature
wild
and
free
unfettered
by
any
sort
of
traditions
she
is
impetuous
volcanic
i
was
about
to
say
she
is
swift
in
making
up
her
mind
and
fearless
in
carrying
out
her
resolutions
on
the
other
hand
i
would
not
have
given
her
the
name
which
i
have
the
honour
to
bear
he
gave
a
little
stately
cough
had
not
i
thought
her
to
be
at
bottom
a
noble
woman
i
believe
that
she
is
capable
of
heroic
and
that
anything
dishonourable
would
be
repugnant
to
her
have
you
her
photograph
i
brought
this
with
me
he
opened
a
locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of
a
very
lovely
woman
it
was
not
a
photograph
but
an
ivory
miniature
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
hair
the
large
dark
eyes
and
the
exquisite
mouth
holmes
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
it
then
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
lord
simon
the
young
lady
came
to
london
then
and
you
renewed
your
acquaintance
yes
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last
london
season
i
met
her
several
times
became
engaged
to
her
and
have
now
married
her
she
brought
i
understand
a
considerable
dowry
a
fair
dowry
not
more
than
is
usual
in
my
family
and
this
of
course
remains
to
you
since
the
marriage
is
a
fait
accompli
i
really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
very
naturally
not
did
you
see
miss
doran
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
yes
was
she
in
good
spirits
never
better
she
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
lives
indeed
that
is
very
interesting
and
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
she
was
as
bright
as
possible
at
least
until
after
the
ceremony
and
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
then
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
saw
then
the
first
signs
that
i
had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just
a
little
sharp
the
incident
however
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
case
pray
let
us
have
it
for
all
that
oh
it
is
childish
she
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
vestry
she
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
time
and
it
fell
over
into
the
pew
there
was
a
moment
delay
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
again
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
fall
yet
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in
the
carriage
on
our
way
home
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
cause
indeed
you
say
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
pew
some
of
the
general
public
were
present
then
oh
yes
it
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
open
this
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife
friends
no
no
i
call
him
a
gentleman
by
courtesy
but
he
was
quite
a
person
i
hardly
noticed
his
appearance
but
really
i
think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
point
lady
simon
then
returned
from
the
wedding
in
a
less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
it
what
did
she
do
on
her
father
house
i
saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
maid
and
who
is
her
maid
alice
is
her
name
she
is
an
american
and
came
from
california
with
her
a
confidential
servant
a
little
too
much
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
liberties
still
of
course
in
america
they
look
upon
these
things
in
a
different
way
how
long
did
she
speak
to
this
alice
oh
a
few
minutes
i
had
something
else
to
think
of
you
did
not
overhear
what
they
said
lady
simon
said
something
about
a
claim
she
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
kind
i
have
no
idea
what
she
meant
american
slang
is
very
expressive
sometimes
and
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
maid
she
walked
into
the
on
your
arm
no
alone
she
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
that
then
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
so
she
rose
hurriedly
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
left
the
room
she
never
came
back
but
this
maid
alice
as
i
understand
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
room
covered
her
bride
dress
with
a
long
ulster
put
on
a
bonnet
and
went
out
quite
so
and
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
hyde
park
in
company
with
flora
millar
a
woman
who
is
now
in
custody
and
who
had
already
made
a
disturbance
at
doran
house
that
morning
ah
yes
i
should
like
a
few
particulars
as
to
this
young
lady
and
your
relations
to
her
lord
simon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
eyebrows
we
have
been
on
a
friendly
footing
for
some
years
i
may
say
on
a
very
friendly
footing
she
used
to
be
at
the
allegro
i
have
not
treated
her
ungenerously
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
me
but
you
know
what
women
are
holmes
flora
was
a
dear
little
thing
but
exceedingly
and
devotedly
attached
to
me
she
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that
i
was
about
to
be
married
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
reason
why
i
had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that
i
feared
lest
there
might
be
a
scandal
in
the
church
she
came
to
doran
door
just
after
we
returned
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
in
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
wife
and
even
threatening
her
but
i
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
sort
and
i
had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
clothes
who
soon
pushed
her
out
again
she
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making
a
row
did
your
wife
hear
all
this
no
thank
goodness
she
did
not
and
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
afterwards
yes
that
is
what
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
looks
upon
as
so
serious
it
is
thought
that
flora
decoyed
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
her
well
it
is
a
possible
supposition
you
think
so
too
i
did
not
say
a
probable
one
but
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
likely
i
do
not
think
flora
would
hurt
a
fly
still
jealousy
is
a
strange
transformer
of
characters
pray
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
place
well
really
i
came
to
seek
a
theory
not
to
propound
one
i
have
given
you
all
the
facts
since
you
ask
me
however
i
may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
affair
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense
a
social
stride
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
wife
in
short
that
she
had
become
suddenly
deranged
well
really
when
i
consider
that
she
has
turned
her
back
i
will
not
say
upon
me
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
success
i
can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
fashion
well
certainly
that
is
also
a
conceivable
hypothesis
said
holmes
smiling
and
now
lord
simon
i
think
that
i
have
nearly
all
my
data
may
i
ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
window
we
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
park
quite
so
then
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
to
detain
you
longer
i
shall
communicate
with
you
should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
problem
said
our
client
rising
i
have
solved
it
eh
what
was
that
i
say
that
i
have
solved
it
where
then
is
my
wife
that
is
a
detail
which
i
shall
speedily
supply
lord
simon
shook
his
head
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine
he
remarked
and
bowing
in
a
stately
manner
he
departed
it
is
very
good
of
lord
simon
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on
a
level
with
his
own
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing
i
think
that
i
shall
have
a
whisky
and
soda
and
a
cigar
after
all
this
i
had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
room
my
dear
holmes
i
have
notes
of
several
similar
cases
though
none
as
i
remarked
before
which
were
quite
as
prompt
my
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into
a
certainty
circumstantial
evidence
is
occasionally
very
convincing
as
when
you
find
a
trout
in
the
milk
to
quote
thoreau
example
but
i
have
heard
all
that
you
have
heard
without
however
the
knowledge
of
cases
which
serves
me
so
well
there
was
a
parallel
instance
in
aberdeen
some
years
back
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
munich
the
year
after
the
war
it
is
one
of
these
cases
but
hullo
here
is
lestrade
lestrade
you
will
find
an
extra
tumbler
upon
the
sideboard
and
there
are
cigars
in
the
box
the
official
detective
was
attired
in
a
and
cravat
which
gave
him
a
decidedly
nautical
appearance
and
he
carried
a
black
canvas
bag
in
his
hand
with
a
short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the
cigar
which
had
been
offered
to
him
what
up
then
asked
holmes
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
look
dissatisfied
and
i
feel
dissatisfied
it
is
this
infernal
simon
marriage
case
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business
really
you
surprise
me
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
mixed
affair
every
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers
i
have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
day
and
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made
you
said
holmes
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
yes
i
have
been
dragging
the
serpentine
in
heaven
name
what
for
in
search
of
the
body
of
lady
st
simon
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
heartily
have
you
dragged
the
basin
of
trafalgar
square
fountain
he
asked
why
what
do
you
mean
because
you
have
just
as
good
a
chance
of
finding
this
lady
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
lestrade
shot
an
angry
glance
at
my
companion
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
it
he
snarled
well
i
have
only
just
heard
the
facts
but
my
mind
is
made
up
oh
indeed
then
you
think
that
the
serpentine
plays
no
part
in
the
matter
i
think
it
very
unlikely
then
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
it
he
opened
his
bag
as
he
spoke
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor
a
of
watered
silk
a
pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and
a
bride
wreath
and
veil
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
water
there
said
he
putting
a
new
upon
the
top
of
the
pile
there
is
a
little
nut
for
you
to
crack
master
holmes
oh
indeed
said
my
friend
blowing
blue
rings
into
the
air
you
dragged
them
from
the
serpentine
no
they
were
found
floating
near
the
margin
by
a
they
have
been
identified
as
her
clothes
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
off
by
the
same
brilliant
reasoning
every
man
body
is
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
wardrobe
and
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
this
at
some
evidence
implicating
flora
millar
in
the
disappearance
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
are
you
indeed
now
cried
lestrade
with
some
bitterness
i
am
afraid
holmes
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
inferences
you
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
minutes
this
dress
does
implicate
miss
flora
millar
and
how
in
the
dress
is
a
pocket
in
the
pocket
is
a
in
the
is
a
note
and
here
is
the
very
note
he
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
listen
to
this
will
see
me
when
all
is
ready
come
at
once
now
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
lady
simon
was
decoyed
away
by
flora
millar
and
that
she
with
confederates
no
doubt
was
responsible
for
her
disappearance
here
signed
with
her
initials
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
reach
very
good
lestrade
said
holmes
laughing
you
really
are
very
fine
indeed
let
me
see
it
he
took
up
the
paper
in
a
listless
way
but
his
attention
instantly
became
riveted
and
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
this
is
indeed
important
said
he
ha
you
find
it
so
extremely
so
i
congratulate
you
warmly
lestrade
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
look
why
he
shrieked
you
looking
at
the
wrong
side
on
the
contrary
this
is
the
right
side
the
right
side
you
mad
here
is
the
note
written
in
pencil
over
here
and
over
here
is
what
appears
to
be
the
fragment
of
a
hotel
bill
which
interests
me
deeply
there
nothing
in
it
i
looked
at
it
before
said
lestrade
rooms
breakfast
cocktail
lunch
glass
sherry
i
see
nothing
in
that
very
likely
not
it
is
most
important
all
the
same
as
to
the
note
it
is
important
also
or
at
least
the
initials
are
so
i
congratulate
you
again
i
wasted
time
enough
said
lestrade
rising
i
believe
in
hard
work
and
not
in
sitting
by
the
fire
spinning
fine
theories
holmes
and
we
shall
see
which
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
first
he
gathered
up
the
garments
thrust
them
into
the
bag
and
made
for
the
door
just
one
hint
to
you
lestrade
drawled
holmes
before
his
rival
vanished
i
will
tell
you
the
true
solution
of
the
matter
lady
simon
is
a
myth
there
is
not
and
there
never
has
been
any
such
person
lestrade
looked
sadly
at
my
companion
then
he
turned
to
me
tapped
his
forehead
three
times
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
hurried
away
he
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
holmes
rose
to
put
on
his
overcoat
there
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
work
he
remarked
so
i
think
watson
that
i
must
leave
you
to
your
papers
for
a
little
it
was
after
five
when
sherlock
holmes
left
me
but
i
had
no
time
to
be
lonely
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived
a
confectioner
man
with
a
very
large
flat
box
this
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of
a
youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
presently
to
my
very
great
astonishment
a
quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
mahogany
there
were
a
couple
of
brace
of
cold
woodcock
a
pheasant
a
pâté
de
foie
gras
pie
with
a
group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
bottles
having
laid
out
all
these
luxuries
my
two
visitors
vanished
away
like
the
genii
of
the
arabian
nights
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
address
just
before
nine
sherlock
holmes
stepped
briskly
into
the
room
his
features
were
gravely
set
but
there
was
a
light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
conclusions
they
have
laid
the
supper
then
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
you
seem
to
expect
company
they
have
laid
for
five
yes
i
fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
in
said
he
i
am
surprised
that
lord
simon
has
not
already
arrived
ha
i
fancy
that
i
hear
his
step
now
upon
the
stairs
it
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
in
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
with
a
very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
features
my
messenger
reached
you
then
asked
holmes
yes
and
i
confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
measure
have
you
good
authority
for
what
you
say
the
best
possible
lord
simon
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
what
will
the
duke
say
he
murmured
when
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
humiliation
it
is
the
purest
accident
i
can
not
allow
that
there
is
any
humiliation
ah
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
standpoint
i
fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
blame
i
can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
otherwise
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
regretted
having
no
mother
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such
a
crisis
it
was
a
slight
sir
a
public
slight
said
lord
simon
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
table
you
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
girl
placed
in
so
unprecedented
a
position
i
will
make
no
allowance
i
am
very
angry
indeed
and
i
have
been
shamefully
used
i
think
that
i
heard
a
ring
said
holmes
yes
there
are
steps
on
the
landing
if
i
can
not
persuade
you
to
take
a
lenient
view
of
the
matter
lord
simon
i
have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
successful
he
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
lady
and
gentleman
lord
simon
said
he
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
and
francis
hay
moulton
the
lady
i
think
you
have
already
met
at
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
erect
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
a
picture
of
offended
dignity
the
lady
had
taken
a
quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
eyes
it
was
as
well
for
his
resolution
perhaps
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
resist
you
angry
robert
said
she
well
i
guess
you
have
every
cause
to
be
pray
make
no
apology
to
me
said
lord
simon
bitterly
oh
yes
i
know
that
i
have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
before
i
went
but
i
was
kind
of
rattled
and
from
the
time
when
i
saw
frank
here
again
i
just
did
know
what
i
was
doing
or
saying
i
only
wonder
i
fall
down
and
do
a
faint
right
there
before
the
altar
perhaps
moulton
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
matter
if
i
may
give
an
opinion
remarked
the
strange
gentleman
we
had
just
a
little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
already
for
my
part
i
should
like
all
europe
and
america
to
hear
the
rights
of
it
he
was
a
small
wiry
sunburnt
man
with
a
sharp
face
and
alert
manner
then
i
tell
our
story
right
away
said
the
lady
frank
here
and
i
met
in
in
mcquire
camp
near
the
rockies
where
pa
was
working
a
claim
we
were
engaged
to
each
other
frank
and
i
but
then
one
day
father
struck
a
rich
pocket
and
made
a
pile
while
poor
frank
here
had
a
claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
nothing
the
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
frank
so
at
last
pa
would
hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
longer
and
he
took
me
away
to
frank
would
throw
up
his
hand
though
so
he
followed
me
there
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it
it
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
know
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
ourselves
frank
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
pile
too
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
pa
so
then
i
promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
lived
should
we
be
married
right
away
then
said
he
then
i
will
feel
sure
of
you
and
i
wo
claim
to
be
your
husband
until
i
come
back
well
we
talked
it
over
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
nicely
with
a
clergyman
all
ready
in
waiting
that
we
just
did
it
right
there
and
then
frank
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and
i
went
back
to
the
next
i
heard
of
frank
was
that
he
was
in
montana
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
arizona
and
then
i
heard
of
him
from
new
mexico
after
that
came
a
long
newspaper
story
about
how
a
miners
camp
had
been
attacked
by
apache
indians
and
there
was
my
frank
name
among
the
killed
i
fainted
dead
away
and
i
was
very
sick
for
months
after
pa
thought
i
had
a
decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
not
a
word
of
news
came
for
a
year
and
more
so
that
i
never
doubted
that
frank
was
really
dead
then
lord
simon
came
to
and
we
came
to
london
and
a
marriage
was
arranged
and
pa
was
very
pleased
but
i
felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
frank
still
if
i
had
married
lord
simon
of
course
i
have
done
my
duty
by
him
we
ca
command
our
love
but
we
can
our
actions
i
went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good
a
wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
be
but
you
may
imagine
what
i
felt
when
just
as
i
came
to
the
altar
rails
i
glanced
back
and
saw
frank
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
pew
i
thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
first
but
when
i
looked
again
there
he
was
still
with
a
kind
of
question
in
his
eyes
as
if
to
ask
me
whether
i
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him
i
wonder
i
did
drop
i
know
that
everything
was
turning
round
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of
a
bee
in
my
ear
i
did
know
what
to
do
should
i
stop
the
service
and
make
a
scene
in
the
church
i
glanced
at
him
again
and
he
seemed
to
know
what
i
was
thinking
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
still
then
i
saw
him
scribble
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
i
knew
that
he
was
writing
me
a
note
as
i
passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out
i
dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
him
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
flowers
it
was
only
a
line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
so
of
course
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
him
and
i
determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
direct
when
i
got
back
i
told
my
maid
who
had
known
him
in
california
and
had
always
been
his
friend
i
ordered
her
to
say
nothing
but
to
get
a
few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
ready
i
know
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
lord
simon
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
people
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
afterwards
i
had
been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before
i
saw
frank
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
park
i
slipped
out
put
on
my
things
and
followed
him
some
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
lord
simon
to
me
seemed
to
me
from
the
little
i
heard
as
if
he
had
a
little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
also
but
i
managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
frank
we
got
into
a
cab
together
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
gordon
square
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
waiting
frank
had
been
a
prisoner
among
the
apaches
had
escaped
came
on
to
found
that
i
had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
england
followed
me
there
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
wedding
i
saw
it
in
a
paper
explained
the
american
it
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
lived
then
we
had
a
talk
as
to
what
we
should
do
and
frank
was
all
for
openness
but
i
was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
again
just
sending
a
line
to
pa
perhaps
to
show
him
that
i
was
alive
it
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
so
frank
took
my
and
things
and
made
a
bundle
of
them
so
that
i
should
not
be
traced
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
them
it
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
paris
only
that
this
good
gentleman
holmes
came
round
to
us
this
evening
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than
i
can
think
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
frank
was
right
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
secret
then
he
offered
to
give
us
a
chance
of
talking
to
lord
simon
alone
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
once
now
robert
you
have
heard
it
all
and
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
given
you
pain
and
i
hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
me
lord
simon
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
attitude
but
had
listened
with
a
frowning
brow
and
a
compressed
lip
to
this
long
narrative
excuse
me
he
said
but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
manner
then
you
wo
forgive
me
you
wo
shake
hands
before
i
go
oh
certainly
if
it
would
give
you
any
pleasure
he
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
him
i
had
hoped
suggested
holmes
that
you
would
have
joined
us
in
a
friendly
supper
i
think
that
there
you
ask
a
little
too
much
responded
his
lordship
i
may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
developments
but
i
can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
them
i
think
that
with
your
permission
i
will
now
wish
you
all
a
very
he
included
us
all
in
a
sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
then
i
trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
company
said
sherlock
holmes
it
is
always
a
joy
to
meet
an
american
moulton
for
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of
a
monarch
and
the
blundering
of
a
minister
in
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
country
under
a
flag
which
shall
be
a
quartering
of
the
union
jack
with
the
stars
and
stripes
the
case
has
been
an
interesting
one
remarked
holmes
when
our
visitors
had
left
us
because
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
inexplicable
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
lady
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
viewed
for
instance
by
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
you
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
all
then
from
the
first
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
me
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
ceremony
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within
a
few
minutes
of
returning
home
obviously
something
had
occurred
during
the
morning
then
to
cause
her
to
change
her
mind
what
could
that
something
be
she
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
out
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
bridegroom
had
she
seen
someone
then
if
she
had
it
must
be
someone
from
america
because
she
had
spent
so
short
a
time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
completely
you
see
we
have
already
arrived
by
a
process
of
exclusion
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
american
then
who
could
this
american
be
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
her
it
might
be
a
lover
it
might
be
a
husband
her
young
womanhood
had
i
knew
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
conditions
so
far
i
had
got
before
i
ever
heard
lord
simon
narrative
when
he
told
us
of
a
man
in
a
pew
of
the
change
in
the
bride
manner
of
so
transparent
a
device
for
obtaining
a
note
as
the
dropping
of
a
bouquet
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
maid
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
which
in
miners
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has
a
prior
claim
to
the
whole
situation
became
absolutely
clear
she
had
gone
off
with
a
man
and
the
man
was
either
a
lover
or
was
a
previous
husband
the
chances
being
in
favour
of
the
latter
and
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
them
it
might
have
been
difficult
but
friend
lestrade
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
know
the
initials
were
of
course
of
the
highest
importance
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within
a
week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
london
hotels
how
did
you
deduce
the
select
by
the
select
prices
eight
shillings
for
a
bed
and
eightpence
for
a
glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
hotels
there
are
not
many
in
london
which
charge
at
that
rate
in
the
second
one
which
i
visited
in
northumberland
avenue
i
learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
francis
moulton
an
american
gentleman
had
left
only
the
day
before
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
him
i
came
upon
the
very
items
which
i
had
seen
in
the
duplicate
bill
his
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
gordon
square
so
thither
i
travelled
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
home
i
ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position
a
little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
lord
simon
in
particular
i
invited
them
to
meet
him
here
and
as
you
see
i
made
him
keep
the
appointment
but
with
no
very
good
result
i
remarked
his
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
gracious
ah
watson
said
holmes
smiling
perhaps
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
either
if
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
wedding
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
fortune
i
think
that
we
may
judge
lord
simon
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
draw
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
violin
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
evenings
xi
the
adventure
of
the
beryl
coronet
holmes
said
i
as
i
stood
one
morning
in
our
looking
down
the
street
here
is
a
madman
coming
along
it
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
alone
my
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
looking
over
my
shoulder
it
was
a
bright
crisp
february
morning
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
sun
down
the
centre
of
baker
street
it
had
been
ploughed
into
a
brown
crumbly
band
by
the
traffic
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
edges
of
the
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
fell
the
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
scraped
but
was
still
dangerously
slippery
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
usual
indeed
from
the
direction
of
the
metropolitan
station
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
attention
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
tall
portly
and
imposing
with
a
massive
strongly
marked
face
and
a
commanding
figure
he
was
dressed
in
a
sombre
yet
rich
style
in
black
shining
hat
neat
brown
gaiters
and
trousers
yet
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
features
for
he
was
running
hard
with
occasional
little
springs
such
as
a
weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
legs
as
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
down
waggled
his
head
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
contortions
what
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
him
i
asked
he
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses
i
believe
that
he
is
coming
here
said
holmes
rubbing
his
hands
here
yes
i
rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
professionally
i
think
that
i
recognise
the
symptoms
ha
did
i
not
tell
you
as
he
spoke
the
man
puffing
and
blowing
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
clanging
a
few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
room
still
puffing
still
gesticulating
but
with
so
fixed
a
look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
pity
for
a
while
he
could
not
get
his
words
out
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
reason
then
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
room
sherlock
holmes
pushed
him
down
into
the
and
sitting
beside
him
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
easy
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
you
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
story
have
you
not
said
he
you
are
fatigued
with
your
haste
pray
wait
until
you
have
recovered
yourself
and
then
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit
to
me
the
man
sat
for
a
minute
or
more
with
a
heaving
chest
fighting
against
his
emotion
then
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
brow
set
his
lips
tight
and
turned
his
face
towards
us
no
doubt
you
think
me
mad
said
he
i
see
that
you
have
had
some
great
trouble
responded
holmes
god
knows
i
have
a
trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
reason
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
it
public
disgrace
i
might
have
faced
although
i
am
a
man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne
a
stain
private
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
man
but
the
two
coming
together
and
in
so
frightful
a
form
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
soul
besides
it
is
not
i
alone
the
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
affair
pray
compose
yourself
sir
said
holmes
and
let
me
have
a
clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
you
my
name
answered
our
visitor
is
probably
familiar
to
your
ears
i
am
alexander
holder
of
the
banking
firm
of
holder
stevenson
of
threadneedle
street
the
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
city
of
london
what
could
have
happened
then
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
london
to
this
most
pitiable
pass
we
waited
all
curiosity
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
story
i
feel
that
time
is
of
value
said
he
that
is
why
i
hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that
i
should
secure
your
i
came
to
baker
street
by
the
underground
and
hurried
from
there
on
foot
for
the
cabs
go
slowly
through
this
snow
that
is
why
i
was
so
out
of
breath
for
i
am
a
man
who
takes
very
little
exercise
i
feel
better
now
and
i
will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as
i
can
it
is
of
course
well
known
to
you
that
in
a
successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
depositors
one
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money
is
in
the
shape
of
loans
where
the
security
is
unimpeachable
we
have
done
a
good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
pictures
libraries
or
plate
yesterday
morning
i
was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when
a
card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
clerks
i
started
when
i
saw
the
name
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
than
well
perhaps
even
to
you
i
had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was
a
name
which
is
a
household
word
all
over
the
earth
one
of
the
highest
noblest
most
exalted
names
in
england
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
attempted
when
he
entered
to
say
so
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through
a
disagreeable
task
holder
said
he
have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
good
i
answered
is
absolutely
essential
to
me
said
he
i
should
have
pounds
at
once
i
could
of
course
borrow
so
trifling
a
sum
ten
times
over
from
my
friends
but
i
much
prefer
to
make
it
a
matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
myself
in
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one
self
under
obligations
how
long
may
i
ask
do
you
want
this
sum
i
asked
monday
i
have
a
large
sum
due
to
me
and
i
shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
advance
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
charge
but
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
once
should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
purse
said
i
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
bear
if
on
the
other
hand
i
am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
firm
then
in
justice
to
my
partner
i
must
insist
that
even
in
your
case
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
taken
should
much
prefer
to
have
it
so
said
he
raising
up
a
square
black
morocco
case
which
he
had
laid
beside
his
chair
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
beryl
coronet
of
the
most
precious
public
possessions
of
the
empire
said
i
he
opened
the
case
and
there
imbedded
in
soft
velvet
lay
the
magnificent
piece
of
jewellery
which
he
had
named
are
enormous
beryls
said
he
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
incalculable
the
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum
which
i
have
asked
i
am
prepared
to
leave
it
with
you
as
my
security
i
took
the
precious
case
into
my
hands
and
looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
client
doubt
its
value
he
asked
at
all
i
only
doubt
propriety
of
my
leaving
it
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that
i
should
not
dream
of
doing
so
were
it
not
absolutely
certain
that
i
should
be
able
in
four
days
to
reclaim
it
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
form
is
the
security
sufficient
understand
holder
that
i
am
giving
you
a
strong
proof
of
the
confidence
which
i
have
in
you
founded
upon
all
that
i
have
heard
of
you
i
rely
upon
you
not
only
to
be
discreet
and
to
refrain
from
all
gossip
upon
the
matter
but
above
all
to
preserve
this
coronet
with
every
possible
precaution
because
i
need
not
say
that
a
great
public
scandal
would
be
caused
if
any
harm
were
to
befall
it
any
injury
to
it
would
be
almost
as
serious
as
its
complete
loss
for
there
are
no
beryls
in
the
world
to
match
these
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
them
i
leave
it
with
you
however
with
every
confidence
and
i
shall
call
for
it
in
person
on
monday
morning
seeing
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
leave
i
said
no
more
but
calling
for
my
cashier
i
ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
pound
notes
when
i
was
alone
once
more
however
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
me
i
could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
me
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
as
it
was
a
national
possession
a
horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
it
i
already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it
however
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
now
so
i
locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
work
when
evening
came
i
felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious
a
thing
in
the
office
behind
me
bankers
safes
had
been
forced
before
now
and
why
should
not
mine
be
if
so
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which
i
should
find
myself
i
determined
therefore
that
for
the
next
few
days
i
would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
me
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
reach
with
this
intention
i
called
a
cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
streatham
carrying
the
jewel
with
me
i
did
not
breathe
freely
until
i
had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
and
now
a
word
as
to
my
household
holmes
for
i
wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
situation
my
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
house
and
may
be
set
aside
altogether
i
have
three
who
have
been
with
me
a
number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
suspicion
another
lucy
parr
the
second
has
only
been
in
my
service
a
few
months
she
came
with
an
excellent
character
however
and
has
always
given
me
satisfaction
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
place
that
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
her
but
we
believe
her
to
be
a
thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
way
so
much
for
the
servants
my
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
describe
it
i
am
a
widower
and
have
an
only
son
arthur
he
has
been
a
disappointment
to
me
holmes
a
grievous
disappointment
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
am
myself
to
blame
people
tell
me
that
i
have
spoiled
him
very
likely
i
have
when
my
dear
wife
died
i
felt
that
he
was
all
i
had
to
love
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for
a
moment
from
his
face
i
have
never
denied
him
a
wish
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had
i
been
sterner
but
i
meant
it
for
the
best
it
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
business
but
he
was
not
of
a
business
turn
he
was
wild
wayward
and
to
speak
the
truth
i
could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
money
when
he
was
young
he
became
a
member
of
an
aristocratic
club
and
there
having
charming
manners
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of
a
number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
habits
he
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
turf
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
allowance
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
honour
he
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
keeping
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
friend
sir
george
burnwell
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
again
and
indeed
i
could
not
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
sir
george
burnwell
should
gain
an
influence
over
him
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
house
and
i
have
found
myself
that
i
could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
manner
he
is
older
than
arthur
a
man
of
the
world
to
his
one
who
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything
a
brilliant
talker
and
a
man
of
great
personal
beauty
yet
when
i
think
of
him
in
cold
blood
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
presence
i
am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which
i
have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
distrusted
so
i
think
and
so
too
thinks
my
little
mary
who
has
a
woman
quick
insight
into
character
and
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
described
she
is
my
niece
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world
i
adopted
her
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
daughter
she
is
a
sunbeam
in
my
house
sweet
loving
beautiful
a
wonderful
manager
and
housekeeper
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as
a
woman
could
be
she
is
my
right
hand
i
do
not
know
what
i
could
do
without
her
in
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
wishes
twice
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
him
for
he
loves
her
devotedly
but
each
time
she
has
refused
him
i
think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
she
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
life
but
now
alas
it
is
too
late
forever
too
late
now
holmes
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
roof
and
i
shall
continue
with
my
miserable
story
when
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
that
night
after
dinner
i
told
arthur
and
mary
my
experience
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
roof
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
client
lucy
parr
who
had
brought
in
the
coffee
had
i
am
sure
left
the
room
but
i
can
not
swear
that
the
door
was
closed
mary
and
arthur
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
coronet
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
it
have
you
put
it
asked
arthur
my
own
bureau
i
hope
to
goodness
the
house
wo
be
burgled
during
the
night
said
he
is
locked
up
i
answered
any
old
key
will
fit
that
bureau
when
i
was
a
youngster
i
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
cupboard
he
often
had
a
wild
way
of
talking
so
that
i
thought
little
of
what
he
said
he
followed
me
to
my
room
however
that
night
with
a
very
grave
face
here
dad
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
down
you
let
me
have
pounds
i
can
not
i
answered
sharply
have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
matters
have
been
very
kind
said
he
i
must
have
this
money
or
else
i
can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
again
a
very
good
thing
too
i
cried
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it
a
dishonoured
man
said
he
could
not
bear
the
disgrace
i
must
raise
the
money
in
some
way
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
it
then
i
must
try
other
means
i
was
very
angry
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
month
shall
not
have
a
farthing
from
me
i
cried
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
when
he
was
gone
i
unlocked
my
bureau
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
safe
and
locked
it
again
then
i
started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
secure
a
duty
which
i
usually
leave
to
mary
but
which
i
thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
night
as
i
came
down
the
stairs
i
saw
mary
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
hall
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as
i
approached
me
dad
said
she
looking
i
thought
a
little
disturbed
you
give
lucy
the
maid
leave
to
go
out
not
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
door
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
someone
but
i
think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
stopped
must
speak
to
her
in
the
morning
or
i
will
if
you
prefer
it
are
you
sure
that
everything
is
fastened
sure
dad
i
kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
again
where
i
was
soon
asleep
i
am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
everything
holmes
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case
but
i
beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which
i
do
not
make
clear
on
the
contrary
your
statement
is
singularly
lucid
i
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
now
in
which
i
should
wish
to
be
particularly
so
i
am
not
a
very
heavy
sleeper
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
tended
no
doubt
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
usual
about
two
in
the
morning
then
i
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
house
it
had
ceased
ere
i
was
wide
awake
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though
a
window
had
gently
closed
somewhere
i
lay
listening
with
all
my
ears
suddenly
to
my
horror
there
was
a
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly
in
the
next
room
i
slipped
out
of
bed
all
palpitating
with
fear
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
my
door
i
screamed
villain
you
thief
how
dare
you
touch
that
coronet
the
gas
was
half
up
as
i
had
left
it
and
my
unhappy
boy
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
was
standing
beside
the
light
holding
the
coronet
in
his
hands
he
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
it
or
bending
it
with
all
his
strength
at
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
death
i
snatched
it
up
and
examined
it
one
of
the
gold
corners
with
three
of
the
beryls
in
it
was
missing
blackguard
i
shouted
beside
myself
with
rage
have
destroyed
it
you
have
dishonoured
me
forever
where
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
stolen
he
cried
thief
i
roared
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
are
none
missing
there
can
not
be
any
missing
said
he
are
three
missing
and
you
know
where
they
are
must
i
call
you
a
liar
as
well
as
a
thief
did
i
not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
piece
have
called
me
names
enough
said
he
will
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
business
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
me
i
will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police
i
cried
with
grief
and
rage
shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
bottom
shall
learn
nothing
from
me
said
he
with
a
passion
such
as
i
should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
nature
you
choose
to
call
the
police
let
the
police
find
what
they
can
by
this
time
the
whole
house
was
astir
for
i
had
raised
my
voice
in
my
anger
mary
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
room
and
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
arthur
face
she
read
the
whole
story
and
with
a
scream
fell
down
senseless
on
the
ground
i
sent
the
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
once
when
the
inspector
and
a
constable
entered
the
house
arthur
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
folded
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
theft
i
answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
private
matter
but
had
become
a
public
one
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
property
i
was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
everything
least
said
he
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
once
it
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if
i
might
leave
the
house
for
five
minutes
you
may
get
away
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
stolen
said
i
and
then
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which
i
was
placed
i
implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than
i
was
at
stake
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise
a
scandal
which
would
convulse
the
nation
he
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
stones
may
as
well
face
the
matter
said
i
have
been
caught
in
the
act
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
heinous
if
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
power
by
telling
us
where
the
beryls
are
all
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask
for
it
he
answered
turning
away
from
me
with
a
sneer
i
saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
him
there
was
but
one
way
for
it
i
called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
custody
a
search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
gems
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
threats
this
morning
he
was
removed
to
a
cell
and
i
after
going
through
all
the
police
formalities
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
matter
the
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
it
you
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
necessary
i
have
already
offered
a
reward
of
pounds
my
god
what
shall
i
do
i
have
lost
my
honour
my
gems
and
my
son
in
one
night
oh
what
shall
i
do
he
put
a
hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
droning
to
himself
like
a
child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
words
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
some
few
minutes
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
do
you
receive
much
company
he
asked
none
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
arthur
sir
george
burnwell
has
been
several
times
lately
no
one
else
i
think
do
you
go
out
much
in
society
arthur
does
mary
and
i
stay
at
home
we
neither
of
us
care
for
it
that
is
unusual
in
a
young
girl
she
is
of
a
quiet
nature
besides
she
is
not
so
very
young
she
is
this
matter
from
what
you
say
seems
to
have
been
a
shock
to
her
also
terrible
she
is
even
more
affected
than
i
you
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son
guilt
how
can
we
have
when
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
i
hardly
consider
that
a
conclusive
proof
was
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
injured
yes
it
was
twisted
do
you
not
think
then
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
it
god
bless
you
you
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
me
but
it
is
too
heavy
a
task
what
was
he
doing
there
at
all
if
his
purpose
were
innocent
why
did
he
not
say
so
precisely
and
if
it
were
guilty
why
did
he
not
invent
a
lie
his
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
ways
there
are
several
singular
points
about
the
case
what
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
sleep
they
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
arthur
closing
his
bedroom
door
a
likely
story
as
if
a
man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake
a
household
what
did
they
say
then
of
the
disappearance
of
these
gems
they
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
have
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
house
yes
they
have
shown
extraordinary
energy
the
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
examined
now
my
dear
sir
said
holmes
is
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
think
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
simple
case
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
complex
consider
what
is
involved
by
your
theory
you
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
bed
went
at
great
risk
to
your
opened
your
bureau
took
out
your
coronet
broke
off
by
main
force
a
small
portion
of
it
went
off
to
some
other
place
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
them
and
then
returned
with
the
other
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
discovered
i
ask
you
now
is
such
a
theory
tenable
but
what
other
is
there
cried
the
banker
with
a
gesture
of
despair
if
his
motives
were
innocent
why
does
he
not
explain
them
it
is
our
task
to
find
that
out
replied
holmes
so
now
if
you
please
holder
we
will
set
off
for
streatham
together
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing
a
little
more
closely
into
details
my
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
expedition
which
i
was
eager
enough
to
do
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
listened
i
confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
banker
son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
father
but
still
i
had
such
faith
in
holmes
judgment
that
i
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
explanation
he
hardly
spoke
a
word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
suburb
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
our
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
him
and
he
even
broke
into
a
desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
affairs
a
short
railway
journey
and
a
shorter
walk
brought
us
to
fairbank
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
financier
fairbank
was
a
square
house
of
white
stone
standing
back
a
little
from
the
road
a
double
with
a
lawn
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
entrance
on
the
right
side
was
a
small
wooden
thicket
which
led
into
a
narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
door
and
forming
the
tradesmen
entrance
on
the
left
ran
a
lane
which
led
to
the
stables
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all
being
a
public
though
little
used
thoroughfare
holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house
across
the
front
down
the
tradesmen
path
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane
so
long
was
he
that
holder
and
i
went
into
the
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return
we
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
came
in
she
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
slim
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
a
woman
face
her
lips
too
were
bloodless
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
as
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
a
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
a
woman
of
strong
character
with
immense
capacity
for
disregarding
my
presence
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
a
sweet
womanly
caress
you
have
given
orders
that
arthur
should
be
liberated
have
you
not
dad
she
asked
no
no
my
girl
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom
but
i
am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent
you
know
what
instincts
are
i
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly
why
is
he
silent
then
if
he
is
innocent
who
knows
perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him
how
could
i
help
suspecting
him
when
i
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand
oh
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it
oh
do
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent
let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more
it
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
arthur
in
prison
i
shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
found
never
mary
your
affection
for
arthur
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
me
far
from
hushing
the
thing
up
i
have
brought
a
gentleman
down
from
london
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it
this
gentleman
she
asked
facing
round
to
me
no
his
friend
he
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone
he
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now
the
stable
lane
she
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
what
can
he
hope
to
find
there
ah
this
i
suppose
is
he
i
trust
sir
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving
what
i
feel
sure
is
the
truth
that
my
cousin
arthur
is
innocent
of
this
crime
i
fully
share
your
opinion
and
i
trust
with
you
that
we
may
prove
it
returned
holmes
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes
i
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
miss
mary
holder
might
i
ask
you
a
question
or
two
pray
do
sir
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up
you
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night
nothing
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly
i
heard
that
and
i
came
down
you
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before
did
you
fasten
all
the
windows
yes
were
they
all
fastened
this
morning
yes
you
have
a
maid
who
has
a
sweetheart
i
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him
yes
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle
remarks
about
the
coronet
i
see
you
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery
but
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories
cried
the
banker
impatiently
when
i
have
told
you
that
i
saw
arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
wait
a
little
holder
we
must
come
back
to
that
about
this
girl
miss
holder
you
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door
i
presume
yes
when
i
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night
i
met
her
slipping
in
i
saw
the
man
too
in
the
gloom
do
you
know
him
oh
yes
he
is
the
who
brings
our
vegetables
round
his
name
is
francis
prosper
he
stood
said
holmes
to
the
left
of
the
door
that
is
to
say
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door
yes
he
did
and
he
is
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady
expressive
black
eyes
why
you
are
like
a
magician
said
she
how
do
you
know
that
she
smiled
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
holmes
thin
eager
face
i
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs
said
he
i
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again
perhaps
i
had
better
take
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
i
go
up
he
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane
this
he
opened
and
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens
now
we
shall
go
upstairs
said
he
at
last
the
banker
was
a
plainly
furnished
little
chamber
with
a
grey
carpet
a
large
bureau
and
a
long
mirror
holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock
which
key
was
used
to
open
it
he
asked
that
which
my
son
himself
indicated
that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
have
you
it
here
that
is
it
on
the
sherlock
holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau
it
is
a
noiseless
lock
said
he
it
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you
this
case
i
presume
contains
the
coronet
we
must
have
a
look
at
it
he
opened
the
case
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
it
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller
art
and
the
stones
were
the
finest
that
i
have
ever
seen
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
a
cracked
edge
where
a
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away
now
holder
said
holmes
here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost
might
i
beg
that
you
will
break
it
off
the
banker
recoiled
in
horror
i
should
not
dream
of
trying
said
he
then
i
will
holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it
but
without
result
i
feel
it
give
a
little
said
he
but
though
i
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it
an
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it
now
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
i
did
break
it
holder
there
would
be
a
noise
like
a
pistol
shot
do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
a
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
it
is
all
dark
to
me
but
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go
what
do
you
think
miss
holder
i
confess
that
i
still
share
my
uncle
perplexity
your
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him
he
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt
thank
you
we
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up
with
your
permission
holder
i
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside
he
went
alone
at
his
own
request
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult
for
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever
i
think
that
i
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see
holder
said
he
i
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms
but
the
gems
holmes
where
are
they
i
can
not
tell
the
banker
wrung
his
hands
i
shall
never
see
them
again
he
cried
and
my
son
you
give
me
hopes
my
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered
then
for
god
sake
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night
if
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
baker
street
rooms
morning
between
nine
and
ten
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
i
can
to
make
it
clearer
i
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you
provided
only
that
i
get
back
the
gems
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
i
may
draw
i
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back
very
good
i
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
i
could
even
dimly
imagine
several
times
during
our
homeward
journey
i
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic
until
at
last
i
gave
it
over
in
despair
it
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more
he
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
dressed
as
a
common
loafer
with
his
collar
turned
up
his
shiny
seedy
coat
his
red
cravat
and
his
worn
boots
he
was
a
perfect
sample
of
the
class
i
think
that
this
should
do
said
he
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace
i
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me
watson
but
i
fear
that
it
wo
do
i
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter
or
i
may
be
following
a
but
i
shall
soon
know
which
it
is
i
hope
that
i
may
be
back
in
a
few
hours
he
cut
a
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition
i
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
swinging
an
old
boot
in
his
hand
he
chucked
it
down
into
a
corner
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
tea
i
only
looked
in
as
i
passed
said
he
i
am
going
right
on
where
to
oh
to
the
other
side
of
the
west
end
it
may
be
some
time
before
i
get
back
do
wait
up
for
me
in
case
i
should
be
late
how
are
you
getting
on
oh
so
so
nothing
to
complain
of
i
have
been
out
to
streatham
since
i
saw
you
last
but
i
did
not
call
at
the
house
it
is
a
very
sweet
little
problem
and
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
a
good
deal
however
i
must
not
sit
gossiping
here
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self
i
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply
his
eyes
twinkled
and
there
was
even
a
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
he
hastened
upstairs
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt
i
waited
until
midnight
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return
so
i
retired
to
my
room
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
a
scent
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise
i
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in
but
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible
you
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you
watson
said
he
but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning
why
it
is
after
nine
now
i
answered
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
he
i
thought
i
heard
a
ring
it
was
indeed
our
friend
the
financier
i
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
a
broad
and
massive
mould
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
shade
whiter
he
entered
with
a
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
i
pushed
forward
for
him
i
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried
said
he
only
two
days
ago
i
was
a
happy
and
prosperous
man
without
a
care
in
the
world
now
i
am
left
to
a
lonely
and
dishonoured
age
one
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another
my
niece
mary
has
deserted
me
deserted
you
yes
her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in
her
room
was
empty
and
a
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table
i
had
said
to
her
last
night
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him
perhaps
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so
it
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note
dearest
uncle
i
feel
that
i
have
brought
trouble
upon
you
and
that
if
i
had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune
might
never
have
occurred
i
can
not
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
ever
again
be
happy
under
your
roof
and
i
feel
that
i
must
leave
you
forever
do
not
worry
about
my
future
for
that
is
provided
for
and
above
all
do
not
search
for
me
for
it
will
be
fruitless
labour
and
an
to
me
in
life
or
in
death
i
am
ever
your
loving
mary
what
could
she
mean
by
that
note
holmes
do
you
think
it
points
to
suicide
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution
i
trust
holder
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles
ha
you
say
so
you
have
heard
something
holmes
you
have
learned
something
where
are
the
gems
you
would
not
think
pounds
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them
i
would
pay
ten
that
would
be
unnecessary
three
thousand
will
cover
the
matter
and
there
is
a
little
reward
i
fancy
have
you
your
here
is
a
pen
better
make
it
out
for
pounds
with
a
dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check
holmes
walked
over
to
his
desk
took
out
a
little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table
with
a
shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up
you
have
it
he
gasped
i
am
saved
i
am
saved
the
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom
there
is
one
other
thing
you
owe
holder
said
sherlock
holmes
rather
sternly
owe
he
caught
up
a
pen
name
the
sum
and
i
will
pay
it
no
the
debt
is
not
to
me
you
owe
a
very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad
your
son
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as
i
should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do
should
i
ever
chance
to
have
one
then
it
was
not
arthur
who
took
them
i
told
you
yesterday
and
i
repeat
that
it
was
not
you
are
sure
of
it
then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known
he
knows
it
already
when
i
had
cleared
it
all
up
i
had
an
interview
with
him
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story
i
told
it
to
him
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
i
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me
your
news
of
this
morning
however
may
open
his
lips
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
then
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery
i
will
do
so
and
i
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
i
reached
it
and
let
me
say
to
you
first
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
sir
george
burnwell
and
your
niece
mary
they
have
now
fled
together
my
mary
impossible
it
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible
it
is
certain
neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
england
a
ruined
gambler
an
absolutely
desperate
villain
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience
your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men
when
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her
as
he
had
done
to
a
hundred
before
her
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart
the
devil
knows
best
what
he
said
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
believe
it
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face
i
will
tell
you
then
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night
your
niece
when
you
had
as
she
thought
gone
to
your
room
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane
his
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow
so
long
had
he
stood
there
she
told
him
of
the
coronet
his
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
a
lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves
and
i
think
that
she
must
have
been
one
she
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants
escapade
with
her
lover
which
was
all
perfectly
true
your
boy
arthur
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
a
soft
tread
pass
his
door
so
he
rose
and
looking
out
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
petrified
with
astonishment
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair
presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
again
and
in
the
light
of
the
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands
she
passed
down
the
stairs
and
he
thrilling
with
horror
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath
he
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain
as
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
a
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
but
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
a
misfortune
this
would
be
for
you
and
how
it
was
to
set
it
right
he
rushed
down
just
as
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
opened
the
window
sprang
out
into
the
snow
and
ran
down
the
lane
where
he
could
see
a
dark
figure
in
the
moonlight
sir
george
burnwell
tried
to
get
away
but
arthur
caught
him
and
there
was
a
struggle
between
them
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
and
his
opponent
at
the
other
in
the
scuffle
your
son
struck
sir
george
and
cut
him
over
the
eye
then
something
suddenly
snapped
and
your
son
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands
rushed
back
closed
the
window
ascended
to
your
room
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene
is
it
possible
gasped
the
banker
you
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks
he
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands
he
took
the
more
chivalrous
view
however
and
preserved
her
secret
and
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet
cried
holder
oh
my
god
what
a
blind
fool
i
have
been
and
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes
the
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
how
cruelly
i
have
misjudged
him
when
i
arrived
at
the
house
continued
holmes
i
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me
i
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions
i
passed
along
the
tradesmen
path
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable
just
beyond
it
however
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door
a
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
a
man
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg
i
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks
while
had
waited
a
little
and
then
had
gone
away
i
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so
i
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks
which
i
took
to
be
the
police
but
when
i
got
into
the
stable
lane
a
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me
there
was
a
double
line
of
tracks
of
a
booted
man
and
a
second
double
line
which
i
saw
with
delight
belonged
to
a
man
with
naked
feet
i
was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son
the
first
had
walked
both
ways
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other
i
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window
where
boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting
then
i
walked
to
the
other
end
which
was
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane
i
saw
where
boots
had
faced
round
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
a
struggle
and
finally
where
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
to
show
me
that
i
was
not
mistaken
boots
had
then
run
down
the
lane
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt
when
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end
i
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue
on
entering
the
house
however
i
examined
as
you
remember
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens
and
i
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out
i
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in
i
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred
a
man
had
waited
outside
the
window
someone
had
brought
the
gems
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son
he
had
pursued
the
thief
had
struggled
with
him
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected
he
had
returned
with
the
prize
but
had
left
a
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent
so
far
i
was
clear
the
question
now
was
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet
it
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
now
i
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids
but
if
it
were
the
maids
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place
there
could
be
no
possible
reason
as
he
loved
his
cousin
however
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret
the
more
so
as
the
secret
was
a
disgraceful
one
when
i
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again
my
conjecture
became
a
certainty
and
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate
a
lover
evidently
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you
i
knew
that
you
went
out
little
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
a
very
limited
one
but
among
them
was
sir
george
burnwell
i
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
a
man
of
evil
reputation
among
women
it
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems
even
though
he
knew
that
arthur
had
discovered
him
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe
for
the
lad
could
not
say
a
word
without
compromising
his
own
family
well
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures
i
took
next
i
went
in
the
shape
of
a
loafer
to
sir
george
house
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
valet
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
before
and
finally
at
the
expense
of
six
shillings
made
all
sure
by
buying
a
pair
of
his
shoes
with
these
i
journeyed
down
to
streatham
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted
the
tracks
i
saw
an
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
evening
said
holder
precisely
it
was
i
found
that
i
had
my
man
so
i
came
home
and
changed
my
clothes
it
was
a
delicate
part
which
i
had
to
play
then
for
i
saw
that
a
prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
scandal
and
i
knew
that
so
astute
a
villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
matter
i
went
and
saw
him
at
first
of
course
he
denied
everything
but
when
i
gave
him
every
particular
that
had
occurred
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down
a
from
the
wall
i
knew
my
man
however
and
i
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
strike
then
he
became
a
little
more
reasonable
i
told
him
that
we
would
give
him
a
price
for
the
stones
he
held
pounds
apiece
that
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
shown
dash
it
all
said
he
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the
three
i
soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
them
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
prosecution
off
i
set
to
him
and
after
much
chaffering
i
got
our
stones
at
pounds
apiece
then
i
looked
in
upon
your
son
told
him
that
all
was
right
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two
after
what
i
may
call
a
really
hard
day
work
a
day
which
has
saved
england
from
a
great
public
scandal
said
the
banker
rising
sir
i
can
not
find
words
to
thank
you
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
done
your
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that
i
have
heard
of
it
and
now
i
must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which
i
have
done
him
as
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor
mary
it
goes
to
my
very
heart
not
even
your
skill
can
inform
me
where
she
is
now
i
think
that
we
may
safely
say
returned
holmes
that
she
is
wherever
sir
george
burnwell
is
it
is
equally
certain
too
that
whatever
her
sins
are
they
will
soon
receive
a
more
than
sufficient
punishment
xii
the
adventure
of
the
copper
beeches
to
the
man
who
loves
art
for
its
own
sake
remarked
sherlock
holmes
tossing
aside
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
daily
telegraph
it
is
frequently
in
its
least
important
and
lowliest
manifestations
that
the
keenest
pleasure
is
to
be
derived
it
is
pleasant
to
me
to
observe
watson
that
you
have
so
far
grasped
this
truth
that
in
these
little
records
of
our
cases
which
you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
up
and
i
am
bound
to
say
occasionally
to
embellish
you
have
given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
célèbres
and
sensational
trials
in
which
i
have
figured
but
rather
to
those
incidents
which
may
have
been
trivial
in
themselves
but
which
have
given
room
for
those
faculties
of
deduction
and
of
logical
synthesis
which
i
have
made
my
special
province
and
yet
said
i
smiling
i
can
not
quite
hold
myself
absolved
from
the
charge
of
sensationalism
which
has
been
urged
against
my
records
you
have
erred
perhaps
he
observed
taking
up
a
glowing
cinder
with
the
tongs
and
lighting
with
it
the
long
pipe
which
was
wont
to
replace
his
clay
when
he
was
in
a
disputatious
rather
than
a
meditative
mood
you
have
erred
perhaps
in
attempting
to
put
colour
and
life
into
each
of
your
statements
instead
of
confining
yourself
to
the
task
of
placing
upon
record
that
severe
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
which
is
really
the
only
notable
feature
about
the
thing
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
done
you
full
justice
in
the
matter
i
remarked
with
some
coldness
for
i
was
repelled
by
the
egotism
which
i
had
more
than
once
observed
to
be
a
strong
factor
in
my
friend
singular
character
no
it
is
not
selfishness
or
conceit
said
he
answering
as
was
his
wont
my
thoughts
rather
than
my
words
if
i
claim
full
justice
for
my
art
it
is
because
it
is
an
impersonal
thing
a
thing
beyond
myself
crime
is
common
logic
is
rare
therefore
it
is
upon
the
logic
rather
than
upon
the
crime
that
you
should
dwell
you
have
degraded
what
should
have
been
a
course
of
lectures
into
a
series
of
tales
it
was
a
cold
morning
of
the
early
spring
and
we
sat
after
breakfast
on
either
side
of
a
cheery
fire
in
the
old
room
at
baker
street
a
thick
fog
rolled
down
between
the
lines
of
houses
and
the
opposing
windows
loomed
like
dark
shapeless
blurs
through
the
heavy
yellow
wreaths
our
gas
was
lit
and
shone
on
the
white
cloth
and
glimmer
of
china
and
metal
for
the
table
had
not
been
cleared
yet
sherlock
holmes
had
been
silent
all
the
morning
dipping
continuously
into
the
advertisement
columns
of
a
succession
of
papers
until
at
last
having
apparently
given
up
his
search
he
had
emerged
in
no
very
sweet
temper
to
lecture
me
upon
my
literary
shortcomings
at
the
same
time
he
remarked
after
a
pause
during
which
he
had
sat
puffing
at
his
long
pipe
and
gazing
down
into
the
fire
you
can
hardly
be
open
to
a
charge
of
sensationalism
for
out
of
these
cases
which
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
interest
yourself
in
a
fair
proportion
do
not
treat
of
crime
in
its
legal
sense
at
all
the
small
matter
in
which
i
endeavoured
to
help
the
king
of
bohemia
the
singular
experience
of
miss
mary
sutherland
the
problem
connected
with
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
and
the
incident
of
the
noble
bachelor
were
all
matters
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
but
in
avoiding
the
sensational
i
fear
that
you
may
have
bordered
on
the
trivial
the
end
may
have
been
so
i
answered
but
the
methods
i
hold
to
have
been
novel
and
of
interest
pshaw
my
dear
fellow
what
do
the
public
the
great
unobservant
public
who
could
hardly
tell
a
weaver
by
his
tooth
or
a
compositor
by
his
left
thumb
care
about
the
finer
shades
of
analysis
and
deduction
but
indeed
if
you
are
trivial
i
can
not
blame
you
for
the
days
of
the
great
cases
are
past
man
or
at
least
criminal
man
has
lost
all
enterprise
and
originality
as
to
my
own
little
practice
it
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
an
agency
for
recovering
lost
lead
pencils
and
giving
advice
to
young
ladies
from
i
think
that
i
have
touched
bottom
at
last
however
this
note
i
had
this
morning
marks
my
i
fancy
read
it
he
tossed
a
crumpled
letter
across
to
me
it
was
dated
from
montague
place
upon
the
preceding
evening
and
ran
thus
dear
holmes
i
am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
i
should
or
should
not
accept
a
situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me
as
governess
i
shall
call
at
ten
if
i
do
not
inconvenience
you
yours
faithfully
violet
hunter
do
you
know
the
young
lady
i
asked
not
i
it
is
ten
now
yes
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
is
her
ring
it
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
think
you
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
carbuncle
which
appeared
to
be
a
mere
whim
at
first
developed
into
a
serious
investigation
it
may
be
so
in
this
case
also
well
let
us
hope
so
but
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
solved
for
here
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
is
the
person
in
question
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
entered
the
room
she
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
with
a
bright
quick
face
freckled
like
a
plover
egg
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of
a
woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
you
will
excuse
my
troubling
you
i
am
sure
said
she
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
her
but
i
have
had
a
very
strange
experience
and
as
i
have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom
i
could
ask
advice
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
i
should
do
pray
take
a
seat
miss
hunter
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
anything
that
i
can
to
serve
you
i
could
see
that
holmes
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
client
he
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
fashion
and
then
composed
himself
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
together
to
listen
to
her
story
i
have
been
a
governess
for
five
years
said
she
in
the
family
of
colonel
spence
munro
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
halifax
in
nova
scotia
and
took
his
children
over
to
america
with
him
so
that
i
found
myself
without
a
situation
i
advertised
and
i
answered
advertisements
but
without
success
at
last
the
little
money
which
i
had
saved
began
to
run
short
and
i
was
at
my
wit
end
as
to
what
i
should
do
there
is
a
agency
for
governesses
in
the
west
end
called
westaway
and
there
i
used
to
call
about
once
a
week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
me
westaway
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
business
but
it
is
really
managed
by
miss
stoper
she
sits
in
her
own
little
office
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
anteroom
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
one
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
them
well
when
i
called
last
week
i
was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
usual
but
i
found
that
miss
stoper
was
not
alone
a
prodigiously
stout
man
with
a
very
smiling
face
and
a
great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with
a
pair
of
glasses
on
his
nose
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
entered
as
i
came
in
he
gave
quite
a
jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
miss
stoper
will
do
said
he
could
not
ask
for
anything
better
capital
capital
he
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
fashion
he
was
such
a
man
that
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
him
are
looking
for
a
situation
miss
he
asked
sir
governess
sir
what
salary
do
you
ask
had
pounds
a
month
in
my
last
place
with
colonel
spence
munro
tut
tut
sweating
rank
sweating
he
cried
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like
a
man
who
is
in
a
boiling
passion
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful
a
sum
to
a
lady
with
such
attractions
and
accomplishments
accomplishments
sir
may
be
less
than
you
imagine
said
i
little
french
a
little
german
music
and
drawing
tut
he
cried
is
all
quite
beside
the
question
the
point
is
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of
a
lady
there
it
is
in
a
nutshell
if
you
have
not
you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of
a
child
who
may
some
day
play
a
considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
country
but
if
you
have
why
then
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
figures
your
salary
with
me
madam
would
commence
at
pounds
a
year
you
may
imagine
holmes
that
to
me
destitute
as
i
was
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
the
gentleman
however
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
face
opened
a
and
took
out
a
note
is
also
my
custom
said
he
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
face
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
beforehand
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
wardrobe
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful
a
man
as
i
was
already
in
debt
to
my
tradesmen
the
advance
was
a
great
convenience
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know
a
little
more
before
i
quite
committed
myself
i
ask
where
you
live
sir
said
i
charming
rural
place
the
copper
beeches
five
miles
on
the
far
side
of
winchester
it
is
the
most
lovely
country
my
dear
young
lady
and
the
dearest
old
my
duties
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
they
would
be
child
one
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
old
oh
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with
a
slipper
smack
smack
smack
three
gone
before
you
could
wink
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
again
i
was
a
little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child
amusement
but
the
father
laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
joking
sole
duties
then
i
asked
to
take
charge
of
a
single
child
no
not
the
sole
not
the
sole
my
dear
young
lady
he
cried
duty
would
be
as
i
am
sure
your
good
sense
would
suggest
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
give
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as
a
lady
might
with
propriety
obey
you
see
no
difficulty
heh
should
be
happy
to
make
myself
useful
so
in
dress
now
for
example
we
are
faddy
people
you
know
faddy
but
if
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
whim
heh
said
i
considerably
astonished
at
his
words
to
sit
here
or
sit
there
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
you
no
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
us
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
as
you
may
observe
holmes
my
hair
is
somewhat
luxuriant
and
of
a
rather
peculiar
tint
of
chestnut
it
has
been
considered
artistic
i
could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
fashion
am
afraid
that
that
is
quite
impossible
said
i
he
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
eyes
and
i
could
see
a
shadow
pass
over
his
face
as
i
spoke
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
essential
said
he
is
a
little
fancy
of
my
wife
and
ladies
fancies
you
know
madam
ladies
fancies
must
be
consulted
and
so
you
wo
cut
your
hair
sir
i
really
could
not
i
answered
firmly
very
well
then
that
quite
settles
the
matter
it
is
a
pity
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
nicely
in
that
case
miss
stoper
i
had
best
inspect
a
few
more
of
your
young
ladies
the
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without
a
word
to
either
of
us
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that
i
could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost
a
handsome
commission
through
my
refusal
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
books
she
asked
you
please
miss
stoper
really
it
seems
rather
useless
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
fashion
said
she
sharply
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening
for
you
to
you
miss
hunter
she
struck
a
gong
upon
the
table
and
i
was
shown
out
by
the
page
well
holmes
when
i
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
cupboard
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
table
i
began
to
ask
myself
whether
i
had
not
done
a
very
foolish
thing
after
all
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
matters
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
eccentricity
very
few
governesses
in
england
are
getting
pounds
a
year
besides
what
use
was
my
hair
to
me
many
people
are
improved
by
wearing
it
short
and
perhaps
i
should
be
among
the
number
next
day
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
and
by
the
day
after
i
was
sure
of
it
i
had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when
i
received
this
letter
from
the
gentleman
himself
i
have
it
here
and
i
will
read
it
to
you
copper
beeches
near
winchester
miss
hunter
miss
stoper
has
very
kindly
given
me
your
address
and
i
write
from
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
reconsidered
your
decision
my
wife
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
for
she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description
of
you
we
are
willing
to
give
pounds
a
quarter
or
pounds
a
year
so
as
to
recompense
you
for
any
little
inconvenience
which
our
fads
may
cause
you
they
are
not
very
exacting
after
all
my
wife
is
fond
of
a
particular
shade
of
electric
blue
and
would
like
you
to
wear
such
a
dress
indoors
in
the
morning
you
need
not
however
go
to
the
expense
of
purchasing
one
as
we
have
one
belonging
to
my
dear
daughter
alice
now
in
philadelphia
which
would
i
should
think
fit
you
very
well
then
as
to
sitting
here
or
there
or
amusing
yourself
in
any
manner
indicated
that
need
cause
you
no
inconvenience
as
regards
your
hair
it
is
no
doubt
a
pity
especially
as
i
could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
interview
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
remain
firm
upon
this
point
and
i
only
hope
that
the
increased
salary
may
recompense
you
for
the
loss
your
duties
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
are
very
light
now
do
try
to
come
and
i
shall
meet
you
with
the
at
winchester
let
me
know
your
train
yours
faithfully
jephro
rucastle
that
is
the
letter
which
i
have
just
received
holmes
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
i
will
accept
it
i
thought
however
that
before
taking
the
final
step
i
should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
consideration
well
miss
hunter
if
your
mind
is
made
up
that
settles
the
question
said
holmes
smiling
but
you
would
not
advise
me
to
refuse
i
confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which
i
should
like
to
see
a
sister
of
mine
apply
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
mr
holmes
ah
i
have
no
data
i
can
not
tell
perhaps
you
have
yourself
formed
some
opinion
well
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
solution
rucastle
seemed
to
be
a
very
kind
man
is
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is
a
lunatic
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
asylum
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbreak
that
is
a
possible
solution
in
fact
as
matters
stand
it
is
the
most
probable
one
but
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
nice
household
for
a
young
lady
but
the
money
holmes
the
money
well
yes
of
course
the
pay
is
good
too
good
that
is
what
makes
me
uneasy
why
should
they
give
you
pounds
a
year
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
pounds
there
must
be
some
strong
reason
behind
i
thought
that
if
i
told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if
i
wanted
your
help
i
should
feel
so
much
stronger
if
i
felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
me
oh
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
you
i
assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
months
there
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
features
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
danger
danger
what
danger
do
you
foresee
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
it
would
cease
to
be
a
danger
if
we
could
define
it
said
he
but
at
any
time
day
or
night
a
telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
help
that
is
enough
she
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
face
i
shall
go
down
to
hampshire
quite
easy
in
my
mind
now
i
shall
write
to
rucastle
at
once
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
and
start
for
winchester
with
a
few
grateful
words
to
holmes
she
bade
us
both
and
bustled
off
upon
her
way
at
least
said
i
as
we
heard
her
quick
firm
steps
descending
the
stairs
she
seems
to
be
a
young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
and
she
would
need
to
be
said
holmes
gravely
i
am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
past
it
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend
prediction
was
fulfilled
a
fortnight
went
by
during
which
i
frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
into
the
unusual
salary
the
curious
conditions
the
light
duties
all
pointed
to
something
abnormal
though
whether
a
fad
or
a
plot
or
whether
the
man
were
a
philanthropist
or
a
villain
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
determine
as
to
holmes
i
observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
end
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
air
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
when
i
mentioned
it
data
data
data
he
cried
impatiently
i
ca
make
bricks
without
clay
and
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such
a
situation
the
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
holmes
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
in
when
i
would
leave
him
stooping
over
a
retort
and
a
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
he
opened
the
yellow
envelope
and
then
glancing
at
the
message
threw
it
across
to
me
just
look
up
the
trains
in
bradshaw
said
he
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
studies
the
summons
was
a
brief
and
urgent
one
please
be
at
the
black
swan
hotel
at
winchester
at
midday
it
said
do
come
i
am
at
my
wit
end
hunter
will
you
come
with
me
asked
holmes
glancing
up
i
should
wish
to
just
look
it
up
then
there
is
a
train
at
nine
said
i
glancing
over
my
bradshaw
it
is
due
at
winchester
at
that
will
do
very
nicely
then
perhaps
i
had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
acetones
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
morning
by
eleven
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
english
capital
holmes
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
down
but
after
we
had
passed
the
hampshire
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
scenery
it
was
an
ideal
spring
day
a
light
blue
sky
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
east
the
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
air
which
set
an
edge
to
a
man
energy
all
over
the
countryside
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
aldershot
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
foliage
are
they
not
fresh
and
beautiful
i
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
baker
street
but
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
do
you
know
watson
said
he
that
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
a
mind
with
a
turn
like
mine
that
i
must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
subject
you
look
at
these
scattered
houses
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
beauty
i
look
at
them
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is
a
feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
there
good
heavens
i
cried
who
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
homesteads
they
always
fill
me
with
a
certain
horror
it
is
my
belief
watson
founded
upon
my
experience
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
london
do
not
present
a
more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
countryside
you
horrify
me
but
the
reason
is
very
obvious
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
can
not
accomplish
there
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of
a
tortured
child
or
the
thud
of
a
drunkard
blow
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
neighbours
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that
a
word
of
complaint
can
set
it
going
and
there
is
but
a
step
between
the
crime
and
the
dock
but
look
at
these
lonely
houses
each
in
its
own
fields
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
law
think
of
the
deeds
of
hellish
cruelty
the
hidden
wickedness
which
may
go
on
year
in
year
out
in
such
places
and
none
the
wiser
had
this
lady
who
appeals
to
us
for
help
gone
to
live
in
winchester
i
should
never
have
had
a
fear
for
her
it
is
the
five
miles
of
country
which
makes
the
danger
still
it
is
clear
that
she
is
not
personally
threatened
no
if
she
can
come
to
winchester
to
meet
us
she
can
get
away
quite
so
she
has
her
freedom
what
can
be
the
matter
then
can
you
suggest
no
explanation
i
have
devised
seven
separate
explanations
each
of
which
would
cover
the
facts
as
far
as
we
know
them
but
which
of
these
is
correct
can
only
be
determined
by
the
fresh
information
which
we
shall
no
doubt
find
waiting
for
us
well
there
is
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
and
we
shall
soon
learn
all
that
miss
hunter
has
to
tell
the
black
swan
is
an
inn
of
repute
in
the
high
street
at
no
distance
from
the
station
and
there
we
found
the
young
lady
waiting
for
us
she
had
engaged
a
and
our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
table
i
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
she
said
earnestly
it
is
so
very
kind
of
you
both
but
indeed
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
do
your
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
me
pray
tell
us
what
has
happened
to
you
i
will
do
so
and
i
must
be
quick
for
i
have
promised
rucastle
to
be
back
before
three
i
got
his
leave
to
come
into
town
this
morning
though
he
little
knew
for
what
purpose
let
us
have
everything
in
its
due
order
holmes
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
listen
in
the
first
place
i
may
say
that
i
have
met
on
the
whole
with
no
actual
from
and
rucastle
it
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
that
but
i
can
not
understand
them
and
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
them
what
can
you
not
understand
their
reasons
for
their
conduct
but
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
occurred
when
i
came
down
rucastle
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
to
the
copper
beeches
it
is
as
he
said
beautifully
situated
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
itself
for
it
is
a
large
square
block
of
a
house
whitewashed
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
weather
there
are
grounds
round
it
woods
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth
a
field
which
slopes
down
to
the
southampton
highroad
which
curves
past
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
front
door
this
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
house
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
lord
southerton
preserves
a
clump
of
copper
beeches
immediately
in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
place
i
was
driven
over
by
my
employer
who
was
as
amiable
as
ever
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
child
there
was
no
truth
holmes
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
baker
street
rucastle
is
not
mad
i
found
her
to
be
a
silent
woman
much
younger
than
her
husband
not
more
than
thirty
i
should
think
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
from
their
conversation
i
have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
years
that
he
was
a
widower
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
philadelphia
rucastle
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
stepmother
as
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
twenty
i
can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father
young
wife
rucastle
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
feature
she
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
reverse
she
was
a
nonentity
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
son
her
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
other
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
possible
he
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
bluff
boisterous
fashion
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be
a
happy
couple
and
yet
she
had
some
secret
sorrow
this
woman
she
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
thought
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
face
more
than
once
i
have
surprised
her
in
tears
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
mind
for
i
have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
a
little
creature
he
is
small
for
his
age
with
a
head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
large
his
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
sulking
giving
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
amusement
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
mice
little
birds
and
insects
but
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
the
creature
holmes
and
indeed
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
story
i
am
glad
of
all
details
remarked
my
friend
whether
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
not
i
shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance
the
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
house
which
struck
me
at
once
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
servants
there
are
only
two
a
man
and
his
wife
toller
for
that
is
his
name
is
a
rough
uncouth
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
whiskers
and
a
perpetual
smell
of
drink
twice
since
i
have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
drunk
and
yet
rucastle
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
his
wife
is
a
very
tall
and
strong
woman
with
a
sour
face
as
silent
as
rucastle
and
much
less
amiable
they
are
a
most
unpleasant
couple
but
fortunately
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
room
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
building
for
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
copper
beeches
my
life
was
very
quiet
on
the
third
rucastle
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
husband
yes
said
he
turning
to
me
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
hunter
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
hair
i
assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
appearance
we
shall
now
see
how
the
dress
will
become
you
you
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
room
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
obliged
the
dress
which
i
found
waiting
for
me
was
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
blue
it
was
of
excellent
material
a
sort
of
beige
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
before
it
could
not
have
been
a
better
fit
if
i
had
been
measured
for
it
both
and
rucastle
expressed
a
delight
at
the
look
of
it
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
vehemence
they
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
which
is
a
very
large
room
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
house
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
floor
a
chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
window
with
its
back
turned
towards
it
in
this
i
was
asked
to
sit
and
then
rucastle
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
began
to
tell
me
a
series
of
the
funniest
stories
that
i
have
ever
listened
to
you
can
not
imagine
how
comical
he
was
and
i
laughed
until
i
was
quite
weary
rucastle
however
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
humour
never
so
much
as
smiled
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
a
sad
anxious
look
upon
her
face
after
an
hour
or
so
rucastle
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
day
and
that
i
might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
edward
in
the
nursery
two
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
again
i
changed
my
dress
again
i
sat
in
the
window
and
again
i
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
répertoire
and
which
he
told
inimitably
then
he
handed
me
a
novel
and
moving
my
chair
a
little
sideways
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
page
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
him
i
read
for
about
ten
minutes
beginning
in
the
heart
of
a
chapter
and
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
dress
you
can
easily
imagine
holmes
how
curious
i
became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
be
they
were
always
very
careful
i
observed
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
window
so
that
i
became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
back
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
but
i
soon
devised
a
means
my
had
been
broken
so
a
happy
thought
seized
me
and
i
concealed
a
piece
of
the
glass
in
my
handkerchief
on
the
next
occasion
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter
i
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
eyes
and
was
able
with
a
little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
me
i
confess
that
i
was
disappointed
there
was
nothing
at
least
that
was
my
first
impression
at
the
second
glance
however
i
perceived
that
there
was
a
man
standing
in
the
southampton
road
a
small
bearded
man
in
a
grey
suit
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
direction
the
road
is
an
important
highway
and
there
are
usually
people
there
this
man
however
was
leaning
against
the
railings
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
up
i
lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
rucastle
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
most
searching
gaze
she
said
nothing
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that
i
had
a
mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
me
she
rose
at
once
said
she
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
miss
hunter
friend
of
yours
miss
hunter
he
asked
i
know
no
one
in
these
parts
me
how
very
impertinent
kindly
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
away
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice
no
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
always
kindly
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
that
i
did
as
i
was
told
and
at
the
same
instant
rucastle
drew
down
the
blind
that
was
a
week
ago
and
from
that
time
i
have
not
sat
again
in
the
window
nor
have
i
worn
the
blue
dress
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
road
pray
continue
said
holmes
your
narrative
promises
to
be
a
most
interesting
one
you
will
find
it
rather
disconnected
i
fear
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which
i
speak
on
the
very
first
day
that
i
was
at
the
copper
beeches
rucastle
took
me
to
a
small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
door
as
we
approached
it
i
heard
the
sharp
rattling
of
a
chain
and
the
sound
as
of
a
large
animal
moving
about
in
here
said
rucastle
showing
me
a
slit
between
two
planks
he
not
a
beauty
i
looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
eyes
and
of
a
vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
darkness
be
frightened
said
my
employer
laughing
at
the
start
which
i
had
given
only
carlo
my
mastiff
i
call
him
mine
but
really
old
toller
my
groom
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
him
we
feed
him
once
a
day
and
not
too
much
then
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
mustard
toller
lets
him
loose
every
night
and
god
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
upon
for
goodness
sake
do
you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
night
for
it
as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
the
warning
was
no
idle
one
for
two
nights
later
i
happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two
in
the
morning
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
day
i
was
standing
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
when
i
was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
beeches
as
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine
i
saw
what
it
was
it
was
a
giant
dog
as
large
as
a
calf
tawny
tinted
with
hanging
jowl
black
muzzle
and
huge
projecting
bones
it
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
that
dreadful
sentinel
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
which
i
do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
done
and
now
i
have
a
very
strange
experience
to
tell
you
i
had
as
you
know
cut
off
my
hair
in
london
and
i
had
placed
it
in
a
great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
one
evening
after
the
child
was
in
bed
i
began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
things
there
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
open
the
lower
one
locked
i
had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
linen
and
as
i
had
still
much
to
pack
away
i
was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
drawer
it
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by
a
mere
oversight
so
i
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
it
the
very
first
key
fitted
to
perfection
and
i
drew
the
drawer
open
there
was
only
one
thing
in
it
but
i
am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
it
was
my
coil
of
hair
i
took
it
up
and
examined
it
it
was
of
the
same
peculiar
tint
and
the
same
thickness
but
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
me
how
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
drawer
with
trembling
hands
i
undid
my
trunk
turned
out
the
contents
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
hair
i
laid
the
two
tresses
together
and
i
assure
you
that
they
were
identical
was
it
not
extraordinary
puzzle
as
i
would
i
could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
meant
i
returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
drawer
and
i
said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
rucastles
as
i
felt
that
i
had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening
a
drawer
which
they
had
locked
i
am
naturally
observant
as
you
may
have
remarked
holmes
and
i
soon
had
a
pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
head
there
was
one
wing
however
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
all
a
door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
tollers
opened
into
this
suite
but
it
was
invariably
locked
one
day
however
as
i
ascended
the
stair
i
met
rucastle
coming
out
through
this
door
his
keys
in
his
hand
and
a
look
on
his
face
which
made
him
a
very
different
person
to
the
round
jovial
man
to
whom
i
was
accustomed
his
cheeks
were
red
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
anger
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
passion
he
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without
a
word
or
a
look
this
aroused
my
curiosity
so
when
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
charge
i
strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which
i
could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
house
there
were
four
of
them
in
a
row
three
of
which
were
simply
dirty
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
up
they
were
evidently
all
deserted
as
i
strolled
up
and
down
glancing
at
them
occasionally
rucastle
came
out
to
me
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
ever
said
he
must
not
think
me
rude
if
i
passed
you
without
a
word
my
dear
young
lady
i
was
preoccupied
with
business
matters
i
assured
him
that
i
was
not
offended
the
way
said
i
seem
to
have
quite
a
suite
of
spare
rooms
up
there
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
up
he
looked
surprised
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
little
startled
at
my
remark
is
one
of
my
hobbies
said
he
have
made
my
dark
room
up
there
but
dear
me
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
upon
who
would
have
believed
it
who
would
have
ever
believed
it
he
spoke
in
a
jesting
tone
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me
i
read
suspicion
there
and
annoyance
but
no
jest
well
holmes
from
the
moment
that
i
understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which
i
was
not
to
know
i
was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
them
it
was
not
mere
curiosity
though
i
have
my
share
of
that
it
was
more
a
feeling
of
duty
a
feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
place
they
talk
of
woman
instinct
perhaps
it
was
instinct
which
gave
me
that
feeling
at
any
rate
it
was
there
and
i
was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
door
it
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
came
i
may
tell
you
that
besides
rucastle
both
toller
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
rooms
and
i
once
saw
him
carrying
a
large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
door
recently
he
has
been
drinking
hard
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
drunk
and
when
i
came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
door
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
there
and
rucastle
were
both
downstairs
and
the
child
was
with
them
so
that
i
had
an
admirable
opportunity
i
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
slipped
through
there
was
a
little
passage
in
front
of
me
unpapered
and
uncarpeted
which
turned
at
a
right
angle
at
the
farther
end
round
this
corner
were
three
doors
in
a
line
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
open
they
each
led
into
an
empty
room
dusty
and
cheerless
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
other
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
them
the
centre
door
was
closed
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
bed
padlocked
at
one
end
to
a
ring
in
the
wall
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
cord
the
door
itself
was
locked
as
well
and
the
key
was
not
there
this
barricaded
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
outside
and
yet
i
could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
darkness
evidently
there
was
a
skylight
which
let
in
light
from
above
as
i
stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
veil
i
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw
a
shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
door
a
mad
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
sight
holmes
my
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
suddenly
and
i
turned
and
ran
ran
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
dress
i
rushed
down
the
passage
through
the
door
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
rucastle
who
was
waiting
outside
said
he
smiling
was
you
then
i
thought
that
it
must
be
when
i
saw
the
door
open
i
am
so
frightened
i
panted
dear
young
lady
my
dear
young
lady
you
can
not
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
was
what
has
frightened
you
my
dear
young
lady
but
his
voice
was
just
a
little
too
coaxing
he
overdid
it
i
was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
him
was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
wing
i
answered
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that
i
was
frightened
and
ran
out
again
oh
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
there
that
said
he
looking
at
me
keenly
what
did
you
think
i
asked
do
you
think
that
i
lock
this
door
am
sure
that
i
do
not
know
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
there
do
you
see
he
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
manner
am
sure
if
i
had
known
then
you
know
now
and
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
again
here
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into
a
grin
of
rage
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of
a
demon
throw
you
to
the
mastiff
i
was
so
terrified
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
did
i
suppose
that
i
must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
room
i
remember
nothing
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
over
then
i
thought
of
you
holmes
i
could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
advice
i
was
frightened
of
the
house
of
the
man
of
the
woman
of
the
servants
even
of
the
child
they
were
all
horrible
to
me
if
i
could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
well
of
course
i
might
have
fled
from
the
house
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
fears
my
mind
was
soon
made
up
i
would
send
you
a
wire
i
put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
went
down
to
the
office
which
is
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
and
then
returned
feeling
very
much
easier
a
horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as
i
approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
loose
but
i
remembered
that
toller
had
drunk
himself
into
a
state
of
insensibility
that
evening
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
creature
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
free
i
slipped
in
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
winchester
this
morning
but
i
must
be
back
before
three
for
and
rucastle
are
going
on
a
visit
and
will
be
away
all
the
evening
so
that
i
must
look
after
the
child
now
i
have
told
you
all
my
adventures
holmes
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
means
and
above
all
what
i
should
do
holmes
and
i
had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
story
my
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
face
is
toller
still
drunk
he
asked
yes
i
heard
his
wife
tell
rucastle
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
that
is
well
and
the
rucastles
go
out
yes
is
there
a
cellar
with
a
good
strong
lock
yes
the
you
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like
a
very
brave
and
sensible
girl
miss
hunter
do
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
feat
i
should
not
ask
it
of
you
if
i
did
not
think
you
a
quite
exceptional
woman
i
will
try
what
is
it
we
shall
be
at
the
copper
beeches
by
seven
my
friend
and
i
the
rucastles
will
be
gone
by
that
time
and
toller
will
we
hope
be
incapable
there
only
remains
toller
who
might
give
the
alarm
if
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
errand
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
her
you
would
facilitate
matters
immensely
i
will
do
it
excellent
we
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
affair
of
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
explanation
you
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
someone
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
chamber
that
is
obvious
as
to
who
this
prisoner
is
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
daughter
miss
alice
rucastle
if
i
remember
right
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
america
you
were
chosen
doubtless
as
resembling
her
in
height
figure
and
the
colour
of
your
hair
hers
had
been
cut
off
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
passed
and
so
of
course
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
also
by
a
curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
tresses
the
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
hers
possibly
her
fiancé
and
no
doubt
as
you
wore
the
girl
dress
and
were
so
like
her
he
was
convinced
from
your
laughter
whenever
he
saw
you
and
afterwards
from
your
gesture
that
miss
rucastle
was
perfectly
happy
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
attentions
the
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
her
so
much
is
fairly
clear
the
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
child
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
ejaculated
my
dear
watson
you
as
a
medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of
a
child
by
the
study
of
the
parents
do
you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
valid
i
have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
children
this
child
disposition
is
abnormally
cruel
merely
for
cruelty
sake
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
father
as
i
should
suspect
or
from
his
mother
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
power
i
am
sure
that
you
are
right
holmes
cried
our
client
a
thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
it
oh
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
creature
we
must
be
circumspect
for
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
cunning
man
we
can
do
nothing
until
seven
at
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
you
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
mystery
we
were
as
good
as
our
word
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
copper
beeches
having
put
up
our
trap
at
a
wayside
the
group
of
trees
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
miss
hunter
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
have
you
managed
it
asked
holmes
a
loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
downstairs
that
is
toller
in
the
cellar
said
she
her
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
rug
here
are
his
keys
which
are
the
duplicates
of
mr
rucastle
you
have
done
well
indeed
cried
holmes
with
enthusiasm
now
lead
the
way
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
business
we
passed
up
the
stair
unlocked
the
door
followed
on
down
a
passage
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
miss
hunter
had
described
holmes
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
bar
then
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
lock
but
without
success
no
sound
came
from
within
and
at
the
silence
holmes
face
clouded
over
i
trust
that
we
are
not
too
late
said
he
i
think
miss
hunter
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
you
now
watson
put
your
shoulder
to
it
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
can
not
make
our
way
in
it
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
strength
together
we
rushed
into
the
room
it
was
empty
there
was
no
furniture
save
a
little
pallet
bed
a
small
table
and
a
basketful
of
linen
the
skylight
above
was
open
and
the
prisoner
gone
there
has
been
some
villainy
here
said
holmes
this
beauty
has
guessed
miss
hunter
intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
off
but
how
through
the
skylight
we
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
it
he
swung
himself
up
onto
the
roof
ah
yes
he
cried
here
the
end
of
a
long
light
ladder
against
the
eaves
that
is
how
he
did
it
but
it
is
impossible
said
miss
hunter
the
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
rucastles
went
away
he
has
come
back
and
done
it
i
tell
you
that
he
is
a
clever
and
dangerous
man
i
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step
i
hear
now
upon
the
stair
i
think
watson
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
ready
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room
a
very
fat
and
burly
man
with
a
heavy
stick
in
his
hand
miss
hunter
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
him
but
sherlock
holmes
sprang
forward
and
confronted
him
you
villain
said
he
where
your
daughter
the
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
round
and
then
up
at
the
open
skylight
it
is
for
me
to
ask
you
that
he
shrieked
you
thieves
spies
and
thieves
i
have
caught
you
have
i
you
are
in
my
power
serve
you
he
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
go
he
gone
for
the
dog
cried
miss
hunter
i
have
my
revolver
said
i
better
close
the
front
door
cried
holmes
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
together
we
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of
a
hound
and
then
a
scream
of
agony
with
a
horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to
an
elderly
man
with
a
red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at
a
side
door
my
god
he
cried
someone
has
loosed
the
dog
it
not
been
fed
for
two
days
quick
quick
or
it
be
too
late
holmes
and
i
rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
house
with
toller
hurrying
behind
us
there
was
the
huge
famished
brute
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
rucastle
throat
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
ground
running
up
i
blew
its
brains
out
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
neck
with
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
him
living
but
horribly
mangled
into
the
house
we
laid
him
upon
the
sofa
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
toller
to
bear
the
news
to
his
wife
i
did
what
i
could
to
relieve
his
pain
we
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
gaunt
woman
entered
the
room
mrs
toller
cried
miss
hunter
yes
miss
rucastle
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
you
ah
miss
it
is
a
pity
you
did
let
me
know
what
you
were
planning
for
i
would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
wasted
ha
said
holmes
looking
keenly
at
her
it
is
clear
that
toller
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
else
yes
sir
i
do
and
i
am
ready
enough
to
tell
what
i
know
then
pray
sit
down
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which
i
must
confess
that
i
am
still
in
the
dark
i
will
soon
make
it
clear
to
you
said
she
and
i
have
done
so
before
now
if
i
could
ha
got
out
from
the
cellar
if
business
over
this
you
remember
that
i
was
the
one
that
stood
your
friend
and
that
i
was
miss
alice
friend
too
she
was
never
happy
at
home
miss
alice
was
from
the
time
that
her
father
married
again
she
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
anything
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
fowler
at
a
friend
house
as
well
as
i
could
learn
miss
alice
had
rights
of
her
own
by
will
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
patient
she
was
that
she
never
said
a
word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
rucastle
hands
he
knew
he
was
safe
with
her
but
when
there
was
a
chance
of
a
husband
coming
forward
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
him
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put
a
stop
on
it
he
wanted
her
to
sign
a
paper
so
that
whether
she
married
or
not
he
could
use
her
money
when
she
would
do
it
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
death
door
then
she
got
better
at
last
all
worn
to
a
shadow
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
off
but
that
did
make
no
change
in
her
young
man
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
be
ah
said
holmes
i
think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
clear
and
that
i
can
deduce
all
that
remains
rucastle
then
i
presume
took
to
this
system
of
imprisonment
yes
sir
and
brought
miss
hunter
down
from
london
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
mr
fowler
that
was
it
sir
but
fowler
being
a
persevering
man
as
a
good
seaman
should
be
blockaded
the
house
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
arguments
metallic
or
otherwise
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
his
fowler
was
a
very
gentleman
said
toller
serenely
and
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
drink
and
that
a
ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
out
you
have
it
sir
just
as
it
happened
i
am
sure
we
owe
you
an
apology
toller
said
holmes
for
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
us
and
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
rucastle
so
i
think
watson
that
we
had
best
escort
miss
hunter
back
to
winchester
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
standi
now
is
rather
a
questionable
one
and
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
beeches
in
front
of
the
door
rucastle
survived
but
was
always
a
broken
man
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
wife
they
still
live
with
their
old
servants
who
probably
know
so
much
of
rucastle
past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
them
fowler
and
miss
rucastle
were
married
by
special
license
in
southampton
the
day
after
their
flight
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of
a
government
appointment
in
the
island
of
mauritius
as
to
miss
violet
hunter
my
friend
holmes
rather
to
my
disappointment
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her
when
once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
problems
and
she
is
now
the
head
of
a
private
school
at
walsall
where
i
believe
that
she
has
met
with
considerable
success
